<blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">
Can someone make a streaming service website that asks about Sharemania because most of the links on Google Drive or Mega are broken?<br>
<br>
I think it would be good because all of you get to make a site and add your favourite Nickelodeon and Disney channels. Other movies and TV shows from different companies. Just one click away, you can watch it on demand.<br>
<br>
<br>
All of you guys can work together to make a website. There are Icarly and Victorious, Zoey 101, and Drake and Josh. I think about making streaming service available on demand in HD.<br>
<br>
annoyed when the link doesn't work anymore. After too many requests, why not make a website streaming service?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What about jellyfin or plex?
