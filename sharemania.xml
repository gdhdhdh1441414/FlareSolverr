<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Info for <i>Portrait Of Art Farmer (Remastered)</i></b></span><br>
<br>
<br>
Although it was not until 1958 (the year this album was recorded) that Art Farmer was voted "New Star" of the year in the Down Beat poll, his reputation had already been established among musicians on the basis of his work with Lionel Hampton, Gigi Gryce, and Gerry Mulligan. Though today he concentrates on the flugelhorn, for many years he achieved a comparable lyricism as a trumpeter, as these sides reveal. With a rhythm section that includes his twin brother, the late Addison Farmer, on bass, as well as pianist Hank Jones and drummer Roy Haynes, he is heard here in three originals (two are blues), and five other appropriate vehicles such as Benny Golson’s "Stablemates." Farmer felt that this was the best album he had made at that stage in his career.<br>
<br>
"The rhythm section is beautifully balanced and offers exemplary support to the leader, whose playing summons elegance, fire and craftsmanship in almost perfect accord, with his ballad playing particularly refined".[1] The Allmusic review called the album "an excellent showcase for trumpeter Art Farmer in the 1950s". (The Penguin Guide to Jazz)<br>
