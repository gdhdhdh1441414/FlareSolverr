Hi! Laura Warshauer is an artist whos been active since 2003 and she has a debut album from 2003 released on CD and posted on her MySpace which is completely lost except two snippets for each song. I've been looking for this album for a while now but it's completely gone, archives of the mp3s on her website on archive.org are dead. Two songs (Two Hearts &amp; Matter of Time) were scrobbled on Last.FM on an unknown date meaning people still own the album but currently nobody has shared it online. The cover art for the album is down below here and I'll put the track list too! Thanks!<br>
<br>
1. Two Hearts<br>
2. Matter of Time<br>
3. In Return<br>
4. Eyes<br>
5. Recapture<br>
6. Barely Human<br>
7. Field Of Chairs<br>
8. Supposed To Happen<br>
9. Untitled<br>
10. Broken Toy<br>
