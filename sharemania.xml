"<b>Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection</b>" is a reissue of American singer-songwriter Katy Perry's third studio album, <i>Teenage Dream</i> (2010). It was released on March 23, 2012, by Capitol Records, nearly two years after the original album. Perry collaborated with producers including Tricky Stewart to refine leftover material from the recording sessions at Playback Recording Studio for <i>Teenage Dream</i>. The final product features three newly recorded songs, which incorporate pop styles previously seen in the original album, an acoustic version of "The One That Got Away" and three additional official remixes.<br>
<br>
Upon its release, <i>Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection</i> was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards the new songs' production but questioned the decision to reissue <i>Teenage Dream</i>. As an independent release, the reissue reached the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. It sold one million copies globally by the end of 2012.<br>
<br>
Two singles were released from <i>Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection</i>. The lead single, "Part of Me", debuted at number one on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, while the second single, "Wide Awake", peaked at number two in the country. Both songs were eventually certified quintuple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record was further promoted with live performances during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards and the 2012 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, in addition to the autobiographical documentary film <i>Katy Perry: Part of Me</i> (2012).<br>
