"<b>Greatest Hits</b>" is a compilation album by Cuban-American singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan, released on October 30, 1992, by Epic Records. The album includes songs with soft rock influenced sounds as well as more upbeat Latin pop works inspired by dance music. The tracks were gathered from various releases over the 1985 to 1992 period.<br>
<br>
Although credited solely to Estefan on the front cover, the album serves as a collection of her greatest hits both as a solo artist and as lead singer of Miami Sound Machine, which later became her backing group. The album also contains four previously unreleased songs. The track listing for the US and Canadian album release differs from alternate releases in various regions. Many international releases of the album include the songs "Dr. Beat" and "Bad Boy", though the Australian and New Zealand release replaced "Bad Boy" with "Cuts Both Ways". A limited edition Australian double CD set was later released featuring a special "Megamix", a medley of Estefan's early dance hits. In 2013, the album was re-released in Brazil under the name <i>Seleção Essencial</i> with a new cover, though the track listing remained the same.<br>
