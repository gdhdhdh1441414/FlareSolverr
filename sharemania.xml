<br>
"<b>Always Remember Us This Way</b>" is a song from the 2018 film <i>A Star Is Born</i> and its soundtrack of the same name, performed by the film's star Ally, played by Lady Gaga. It was released as soundtrack's second single in Italy and France in January 2019 and it is among the most popular songs of the entire soundtrack. The song was written by Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, and Lori McKenna, and produced by Dave Cobb and Lady Gaga and also features background vocals from Hemby, Lindsey and McKenna.<br>
<br>
In the movie, Ally sings this song live, during one of Jackson's concerts. As happened a few times before, he gives her the chance to perform in his show with no prior warning, knowing that she would otherwise be too nervous to accept the offer. Unlike Ally's first time on stage, this time she comes across with confidence, which makes the audience fall in love with her almost immediately.<br>
<br>
The song has received widespread critical acclaim and has reached the top of the record chart in Iceland and the top ten in Belgium (both Flanders and Wallonia), Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, the digital charts of Luxembourg, Slovakia and the combined European chart. The track has also reached the top twenty in Denmark, Estonia, France, Malaysia, and on the digital chart of Czech Republic. It reached the top twenty of the Australian and New Zealand charts, while achieving triple platinum certification from the former governing body.<br>
<br>
"Always Remember Us This Way" received a nomination for Song of the Year at the 62nd Grammy Awards, the second nomination from the album in this category after "Shallow", which was nominated for the year before.<br>
<br>
A music video for the song was released, showing the sequence from the film when Gaga sings the track after being introduced by Jackson onstage, who sweetly tells her, "I love you, I'll always remember us this way". A vertical-shaped version of the clip was released to Spotify. Brooke Bajgrowicz from <i>Billboard</i> explained that the "reflective video" showed Ally and Jackson "falling in love with each other", while interspersed with scenes of the couple going on a motorbike ride, kissing in a parking lot and performing music together.<br>
