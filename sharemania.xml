"<b>The Power</b>" is a song by German Eurodance group Snap!, released as their debut single. It was released on 3 January 1990 as the lead single from their debut studio album, <i>World Power</i> (1990). The song reached number one in Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the UK and Zimbabwe, as well as on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Rap charts. On the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, "The Power" managed to reach number two for one week.<br>
<br>
Written and produced by Michael Münzing and Luca Anzilotti (under the pseudonyms Benito Benites and John "Virgo" Garrett III), "The Power" went through several renditions. The original version was released on 3 January 1990 through Logic Records in Germany and contains samples from "Let the Words Flow" by Chill Rob G, "Love's Gonna Get You" by Jocelyn Brown, and "King of the Beats" by Mantronix. Despite it becoming an early 1990 hit in Germany and appearing on the Dance Singles chart in the UK, none of the credited vocals were cleared, and Stu Fine, former owner of Wild Pitch Records, wanted to release the song in the United States. Rob G, who was signed to Wild Pitch, consented, initially thinking the deal could be lucrative for his career. Wild Pitch issued a stateside single and video with his lyrics from "Let the Words Flow" on 5 March 1990. However, this version was credited under Power Jam and not Snap!.<br>
Simultaneously, Arista Records wished to release their own edition in the US, but because it was not legally possible for the label to simply reissue the original German single, it was decided to re-record the entire track with new lyrics by rapper Durron Butler, known as Turbo B, and additional vocals by Penny Ford. The samples were then all legally cleared and the song was finally re-released under the new name Snap! on 12 March 1990 in the UK and 6 April 1990 in the US, despite the fact that Jocelyn Brown had commenced legal action because of the unauthorized sampling of her vocals.<br>
<br>
This song opens with the spoken Russian "Американская фирма Transceptor Technology приступила к производству компьютеров „Персональный спутник" (meaning "The American company Transceptor Technology has started production of the 'Personal Companion' computer"). "Personal Companion" was a computer-like device for the blind and visually impaired. Released in 1990, it was controlled by voice and could, among other functions, automatically download articles from <i>USA Today</i> by a built-in modem. It was made by Transceptor Technologies of Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br>
