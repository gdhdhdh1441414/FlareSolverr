<div style="text-align: center">The Ill Na Na, Foxy Brown is one of rap's most revolutionary and controversial figures. Making her debut at just 16 years old, her quick rise to stardom was backed by legendary guest appearances on songs by rap's most prominent figures. Becoming an instant sensation led to a bidding war for the signing of the young star, where she eventually signed to Def Jam in 1996. Following this, she released her debut album 'Ill Na Na' in 1996, followed by 'Chyna Doll' and 'Broken Silence' in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Her fourth album 'Ill Na Na 2: The Fever' was intended to be released in 2003, executive-produced by Diddy. However, due to disagreements between the two, the album was cancelled. Upon this, she returned to Def Jam in 2004. Accompanied by Jay-Z, she geared up to release her 'fifth' album titled 'Black Roses'. The album was scheduled for release in 2005, however in the preceding weeks, she lost her hearing. After her hearing restored, the album resumed recording. However, after being pushed back for release in 2006 and then 2007, the album was eventually cancelled. She later dropped a mixtape in 2008, titled 'Brooklyn's Don Diva'. Everything from rapping to modelling to acting, Foxy Brown has done it all and due to her distinctive rapping style and indisputable edge, she will remain one of the best to ever touch the mic.<br>
