"<b>Virtual Insanity</b>" is a song by British funk band Jamiroquai. It was released as the second single from their third studio album, <i>Travelling Without Moving</i> (1996), on 19 August 1996. It interpolates parts of Jocelyn Brown's post-disco hit "Somebody Else's Guy" (1984). The song's award-winning music video was released in September 1996. "Virtual Insanity" was a number-one hit in Iceland and reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. As well as becoming a top-ten hit in Finland, Ireland, and Italy, the song also climbed to number 38 on the <i>Billboard</i> Modern Rock Tracks chart upon the single's release in the United States in 1997. The song also earned the band a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group.<br>
<br>
The song's lyrics took inspiration from a walk in an underground city in Sapporo, Japan: "everything was covered in snow and there was absolutely no one about. [We took] these stairs that led down to this whole underground city … with all the colour and noise you get in Japanese streets."<br>
<br>
"Virtual Insanity" is Jamiroquai's best-known music video. It was directed by English filmmaker, director, and screenwriter Jonathan Glazer. At the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in September 1997, it earned 10 nominations, winning four awards, including "Breakthrough Video" and the "Best Video of the Year". In 2006, it was voted 9th by MTV viewers in a poll on music videos that 'broke the rules.' The single was released in the U.S. in 1997. At the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, Jamiroquai performed the song, recreating the famous floor moving concept with two moving rooms on wheels, going in different directions, for Jay Kay to use to dance on.<br>
<br>
<b>*</b> Sony Music released Jamiroquai's first three albums as two-CD deluxe editions on 11 March 2013 to celebrate 20 years since their first album on the label. <i>Emergency On Planet Earth (1993)</i>, <i>The Return Of The Space Cowboy (1994)</i>, and <i>Travelling Without Moving (1996) </i>have been remastered and come with bonus discs of B-sides, live performances, and rarities.<br>
<br>
In September 2021, a long-hyped remaster of the video in 4K was premiered on YouTube to promote a new vinyl release of <i>Travelling Without Moving</i>.<br>
