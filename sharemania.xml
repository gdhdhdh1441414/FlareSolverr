<br>
<br>
The Kinks continue to celebrate their 60th Anniversary this year with the upcoming release of the second part of their career-spanning anthology series The Journey.<br>
<br>
The Journey is a collection of tracks chosen by The Kinks' Ray Davies, Dave Davies and Mick Avory that reflect the trials and tribulations of their journey through life together as a band since 1963. The albums are split into themed sections created by The Kinks.<br>
<br>
The Journey – Part 2 includes singles, B-sides, album tracks and, notably, six new Ray Davies mixes, three of which are previously unreleased live performances from the New Victoria Theatre, London in 1975. ‘Everybody’s a Star (Starmaker) (Live, 2023 Mix).<br>
<br>
Among the other enduring Kinks hits featured on this release include “Lola,” “Sunny Afternoon,” “20th Century Man,” “Dedicated Follower Of Fashion,” “Till The End Of The Day,” “A Well Respected Man,” “See My Friends” and “Big Sky” just to name a few. The inclusion of deeper cuts like “Animal Farm,” “Scrapheap City” and “Wicked Annabella” indicates that, like it’s predecessor, this collection is far from being just another greatest hits cash grab.<br>
<br>
“I thought I knew everything about my songs until I was given the opportunity to put this record together,” Ray Davies said in a statement. “The new sequencing has enabled us to show the ‘big picture’ and give a more insightful back story about how our music evolved. I learned a lot about myself in putting this together.”<br>
<br>
“Another chance to listen to some of my favourite Kinks releases over the years,” adds brother Dave. “A perfect example of our diverse and creative musical legacy.”<br>
<br>
“A strong selection of Kinks songs across the years that should give the listener some nice surprises,” promises Avory.<br>
<br>
The songs featured on The Journey – Part 2 were selected from the following Kinks albums: Face To Face, The Kink Kontroversy, Something Else, The Village Green Preservation Society, Lola Versus Powerman and The Moneygoround, Muswell Hillbillies, Everybody’s In Show-Biz, Preservation Acts 1 &amp; 2 and A Soap Opera (which we hope gets a separate reissue soon).<br>
<br>
All tracks have been carefully remastered by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Studios in LA, overseen by Andrew Sandoval.<br>
