Lyrics : It's been a long time since you fell in love / You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself / Tell me, what must I do? Do tell my love / 'Cause luckily I'm good at reading / I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin' / And we can dance all day around it / If you frontin', I'll be bouncing / If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe / Before I leave you dry / / Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment / I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so? / Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with / You got to keep me focused. You want it? Say so / Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment / I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so? / Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with / You got to keep me focused. You want it? Say so (Yeah) / / Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha) / He ain't never seen it in a dress like this (Ah) / He ain't never even been impressed like this / Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip / Like it, love it, need it, bad / Take it, own it, steal it, fast / Boy, stop playing, grab my ass / Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot) / Shut it, save it, keep it, push / Why you beating 'round the bush? / Knowing you want all this woman / Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah) / All of them bitches hating I have you with me / All of my niggas saying you mad committed / Realer than anybody you had, and pretty / All of that body-ody the ass and titties / / Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment / I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so? / Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with / You got to keep me focused. You want it? Say so / Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment / I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so? / Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with / You got to keep me focused. You want it? Say so<br>
