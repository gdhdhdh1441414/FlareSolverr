​</div><b>Natasha Ramos</b> is an American singer-songwriter from Harford, CT. She is best known for being a background singer on several songs by entertainer Jennifer Lopez; most notably, "<b>Jenny from the Block</b>." <br>
<br>
For years, rumors have alleged that Ramos' backup vocals were used as lead vocals on multiple tracks from Lopez's 2002 album, <i>This Is Me... Then</i>. In 2024, Ramos herself confirmed the rumors on TikTok, noting that her vocals can be heard on "I'm Glad," "The One," "Loving You," "Baby I Love U!" and the aforementioned "Jenny from the Block."<br>
<br>
Ramos was originally signed to Arista Records in 2003. That same year, she recorded a song with The Neptunes, "Midnight Hour." She left the label in 2004 and subsequently signed with Star Trak, the record imprint co-owned by Pharrell Williams. In 2006, she began work on her first studio album, <b><i>Show &amp; Prove</i></b>, set for release that same year. For reasons unknown, the album was shelved in 2007.<br>
<br>
Ramos eventually released several tracks slated for <i>Show &amp; Prove</i> on her 2011 mixtape, <i>Feelin' Myself</i>. Other songs from the project have leaked.<br>
