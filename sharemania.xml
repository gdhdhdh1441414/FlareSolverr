Hi!<br>
<br>
Shania Twain performed recently at Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final in Canada. There are lots of Instagram stories and other videos of her, but I'm hoping someone is able to help me get the PROSHOT footage. I have no idea where to look for or download the Stanley Cup as I do not follow sports! She performed like 7 songs, looked and sounded flawless, and we need this performance in HD.<br>
<br>
Please help if you can!<br>

Wasn't even all that serious about going but was helping my sister with San Diego ticket strategy and was almost going to go to that show and ride back with her then fly to Florida. Long story but none of that happening. I really wanted to catch a full Turnstile set and also Destroy Boys was fun the other time I saw them. Decided to go down and see what would happen since it had the earliest start time of the 3 shows on my calendar. Offered a few people outside $40 and they pretty much laughed in my face. I was one or two light cycles away from crossing the street to the bus and going to one of the backup gigs when someone took the offer for GA Floor. Prices stayed pretty high until they took the show offline too.<br>
<br>
Turnstile probably came out the best but no way I could hang in that spot, it was pretty hard on me even with earplugs.<br>

By way of introduction I have been recording and trading concerts since 1988, I have been mostly posting to my own personal blog titled same as my user name and also just about wrapping up a personal project of transferring thousands of recordings my recently deceased friend made between 1971 and 2017 more recently using anniversary dates as a guide to wrap it up. This is more of a lifestyle than a hobby.<br>
<br>
Seems my pop related stuff will have more appreciation here than the classic rock-centric trading world.<br>
<br>
When I have some time I will drop my Spice Girls collection.
