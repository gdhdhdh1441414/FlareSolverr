<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Info for <i>99 Nights</i></b></span><br>
<br>
Charlotte Cardin has announced that she will release her new album. The album is titled "99 Nights" and will be released on 25 August via Cult Nation/Atlantic Records.<br>
<br>
It is the follow-up album to her debut album "Phoenix", which was released in 2021. "Phoenix" earned her four awards at the Juno Awards. It received glowing reviews, reached platinum status in Canada and won Best Artist, Best Album, Best Pop Album and Best Single of the Year at the 2022 Juno Awards. It was also nominated for the Polaris Music Prize 2022. The album was praised by HYPEBAE for its infectious melodies and impressive vocals and stayed at #1 in Canada for a fortnight. It helped their international streaming numbers surpass the 300 million mark. The release of "Phoenix" was accompanied by an elaborately produced and stirring livestream performance called "The Phoenix Experience". An expanded deluxe edition of the album followed later in the year. Notable songs from the album include "Meaningless" and "Sex To Me", the latter of which was heard on the second season of the Netflix series "Sex/Life" just last month.<br>
<br>
"We called it 99 Nights because it was a big journey through all these worlds that I had to explore to get in touch with the most important things in my life," she reveals. "I realised that I had to get the hell away from where I was. The 99 Nights is a symbol of one chapter ending and a new one beginning. It's nostalgic because there's an ending, but it's also very hopeful because I'm starting over. The first few months of the process drew a path for the sound, the emotions and the stories I will share, hence the title."<br>
