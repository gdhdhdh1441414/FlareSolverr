<br>
"<b>Driver's Seat</b>" is a 1978 song by British band Sniff 'n' The Tears, released as a single from their 1979 debut album <i>Fickle Heart</i>. The song reached the top 20 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States upon its release, as well as the top 10 in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>
In 1991, the song made the number one spot in the Netherlands after it was used in a commercial for the Pioneer car stereo throughout Europe.<br>
<br>
The genesis of the song dates back to the mid-'70s when a demo tape was recorded for a French record label who had signed singer/guitarist Paul Roberts. Luigi Salvoni, who had organised the musicians for Roberts, was listening to the demos a couple of years later when he contacted Roberts to ask if he could try and get a deal. At this time, Roberts was concentrating on his career as a painter. Roberts agreed and they signed to indie label Chiswick Records. They recorded the album <i>Fickle Heart</i> with mostly the same musicians that had done the demos which included along with Roberts and Salvoni, Mick Dyche, Loz Netto, Alan Fealdman, Chris Birkin and Keith Miller on Moog. To the surprise of everyone, <i>Fickle Heart</i> did very well and "Driver's Seat" became a hit. According to Roberts, "Driver's Seat" isn't about driving, but rather "fragmented, conflicting thoughts and emotions that might follow the break-up of a relationship."<br>

"<b>Lola</b>" is a song by the English rock band the Kinks, written by frontman Ray Davies for their 1970 album <i>Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One</i>. The song details a romantic encounter in a Soho bar between a young man and the eponymous Lola, who is possibly a trans woman or cross-dresser. In the song, the narrator describes his confusion towards Lola, who "walked like a woman but talked like a man", yet he remains infatuated with her.<br>
<br>
The song was released as a single in the United Kingdom on 12 June 1970, while in the United States it was released on 28 June 1970. Commercially, "Lola" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The track has since become one of the Kinks' most popular songs and was ranked number 386 on <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s 2021 edition of its "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list. "Lola" was also ranked number 473 on NME's own "The 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time" list.<br>
<br>
The guitar opening on the song was produced as a result of combining the sound of a Martin guitar and a vintage Dobro resonator guitar. Ray Davies cited this blend of guitar sounds for the song's unique guitar sound.<br>
<br>
Since its release, "Lola" has appeared on multiple compilation and live albums. In 1980, a live version of the song from the album <i>One for the Road</i> was released as a single in the US and some European countries, becoming a minor hit. In the Netherlands it reached number 1, just as in 1970 with the studio version. Other versions include an instrumental on the band's 1971 movie soundtrack album <i>Percy</i> and live renditions from 1972's <i>Everybody's in Show-Biz</i> and 1996's <i>To the Bone</i>. The Lola character also appears in the lyrics of the band's 1981 song "Destroyer".<br>
<br>
Originally, "Lola" saw controversy for its lyrics. In a <i>Record Mirror</i> article entitled "Sex Change Record: Kink Speaks", Ray Davies addressed the matter, saying, "It really doesn't matter what sex Lola is, I think she's all right". Some radio stations faded the track out before implications of Lola's biological sex were revealed. On 18 November 1970, "Lola" was banned from being played by several radio stations in Australia because of its "controversial subject matter", though some began playing "Lola" again after having made a crude edit, which sounded like the record had jumped a groove, to remove the line "I'm glad I'm a man and so's Lola".<br>
<br>
The BBC banned the track for a different reason: the original stereo recording had the words "Coca-Cola" in the lyrics, but because of BBC Radio's policy against product placement, Ray Davies was forced to make a 6,000-mile (9,700 km) round-trip flight from New York to London and back on June 3, 1970, interrupting the band's American tour, to change those words to the generic "cherry cola" for the single release, which is included on various compilation albums as well.<br>
