<br>
"<b>Miss a Thing</b>" is a song by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It appears as the second track on Minogue's fifteenth studio album, <i>Disco</i> (2020). The song was co-written by Minogue, Ally Ahern, and producers Teemu Brunila and Nico Stadi. Musically, it is a disco-pop hybrid that incorporates electric guitars and lush string arrangements while expressing both a classic and modern interpretation of the disco genre. The song's composition was compared to that of various artists, most notably French music duo Daft Punk. Lyrically, it explores themes of love and having fun on the dancefloor. An extended version of the song was included on the remix album <i>Disco: Extended Mixes</i> (2021).<br>
<br>
Some music critics praised "Miss a Thing" for its lush production, and experimentation with various sounds and genres, while others thought it was overproduced and unoriginal. A few critics considered it a contender for a single from the parent album. Despite not being released as a single, it appeared on the US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart and the UK Independent Singles chart during the release week of <i>Disco</i>.<br>
<br>
Minogue began working on new music in 2019, after completing the promotion for her fourteenth studio album, <i>Golden</i> (2018), and subsequent tour. During her tour, she was inspired by a segment influenced by the disco aesthetic and Studio 54, and she realised that her creative path would be "heading straight back to the dance floor" with a disco-themed album. According to Minogue, she received a demo recording of "Miss a Thing" in February 2020. When she first heard the demo, she thought it fit the parent album's disco aesthetic: "There was enough disco in there, but it felt like a fresh interpretation," she said when reviewing the record on Apple Music.<br>
<br>
She was scheduled to fly to Los Angeles to continue working on the song with one of the original songwriters, Teemu Brunila. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread lockdowns, production ceased. During the lockdown, Minogue worked remotely from her London home, experimenting with different software and engineering tools such as Logic Pro and GarageBand. She expressed her frustrations during the recording process, claiming that she was unable to achieve certain vocal deliveries while singing the song. She eventually finished it while corresponding with Brunila remotely.<br>
<br>
On July 22, 2021, Minogue released a music video for "Miss a Thing" on her YouTube channel. British filmmaker and longtime collaborator Sophie Muller directed the video, and was shot by Robbie Ryan using vintage Ikegami 79D TV cameras. The result is a "hypnotic montage, with simple mirror VFX enhancing the mood, and the vintage camera adding texture."<br>
