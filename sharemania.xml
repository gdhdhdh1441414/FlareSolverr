"<b>Mad World</b>" is a 1982 song by English pop rock band Tears for Fears. Written by Roland Orzabal and sung by bassist Curt Smith, it was the band's third single release and first chart hit, reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart in November 1982. Both "Mad World" and its B-side, "Ideas as Opiates", appeared on the band's debut LP <i>The Hurting</i> (1983).<br>
"Mad World" was the first single off the finished album. The intention was to gain attention from it and hopefully build up a little following. They had no idea that it would become a hit. Nor did the record company. It was also the band's first international success, reaching the Top 40 in several countries in 1982–83.<br>
<br>
The song is about a depressed young person who feels out of place in this world. He sees life as being empty, and looks for ways to escape the pain. The line, "The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had" suggests thoughts of suicide, but according to Roland Orzabal, who wrote the lyrics, it relates to the psychologist Arthur Janov's idea that our most dramatic dreams release the most tension. So, the guy in the song isn't necessarily looking to die - he wakes up from morbid, lucid dreams feeling better.<br>
<br>
Roland Orzabal came up with this song when he was living in an apartment in Bath, England, with his girlfriend, Caroline, who later became his wife. She was working three jobs so he could work on his music (a keeper, for sure!). Orzabal spent a lot of time strumming his acoustic guitar while staring out the window, watching people go about their business. <i>"It's a bizarre viewpoint to watch people go about their daily routine, having to work for a living when you're sitting in a flat, unemployed,"</i> he told Top 2000 a gogo. <i>"That's where it came from."</i><br>
<br>
"Mad World" was sung by the group's other vocalist and bassist, Curt Smith, who connected with the tune right way. He explained it <i>"was easy for me to sing because I could relate to Roland's lyrics. We were both the middle of three sons and had been brought up by single mothers with absent fathers. My father always worked away, and died when I was 17, but I hated him by that point. It hit me later in life, but back then I was teenage and angry. The song was the perfect platform. It worked better with my voice because it's more melancholic, darker."</i><br>
<br>
The promotional video for "Mad World" was filmed in late summer 1982, in the grounds of Knebworth House and was directed by Clive Richardson who was notable for his work at that time with Depeche Mode. It was Tears for Fears' first music video, and features Curt Smith staring out of a window while Roland Orzabal dances outside on a lakeside jetty. A brief party scene in the video features friends and family of the band, including Smith's mother as well as his then-wife Lynne.<br>
According to Curt Smith, <i>"When we made the video in a country estate on the cheap, we bussed all our friends and family up from Bath and had a fun day. The woman who's having the birthday party in the video is my mum."</i><br>
