"<b>I Will Always Love You</b>" is a song written and originally recorded in 1973 by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. Written as a farewell to her business partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, expressing Parton's decision to pursue a solo career. The country single was released in 1974. The song was a commercial success for Parton, twice reaching the top spot of <i>Billboard</i> Hot Country Songs: first in June 1974, then again in October 1982, with a re-recording for <i>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</i> soundtrack.<br>
<br>
Whitney Houston recorded a soul-ballad arrangement of the song for the 1992 film <i>The Bodyguard</i>, her film debut. The song has a saxophone solo by Kirk Whalum. She was originally to record Jimmy Ruffin's "What Becomes of the Brokenhearted" as the lead single from <i>The Bodyguard</i>. However, when it was discovered the song was to be used for <i>Fried Green Tomatoes</i>, Houston requested a different song. It was her co-star Kevin Costner who suggested "I Will Always Love You", playing her Linda Ronstadt's 1975 version from her album <i>Prisoner in Disguise</i>. Producer David Foster and Houston re-arranged the song as a soul ballad. Her record company did not feel a song with an a cappella introduction would be as successful; however, Houston and Costner insisted on retaining it. When Parton heard that Houston was using Ronstadt's recording as a template, she called Foster to give him the final verse, which was missing from the Ronstadt recording, as she felt it was important to the song. Houston's rendition of the song was issued as the soundtrack's leading single on November 3, 1992, by Arista Records.<br>
<br>
Houston's recording is not the only version of the song featured in the film. In a scene where she dances with Costner, a version by John Doe can be heard playing on a jukebox.<br>
<br>
Houston's version appears at No. 9 on <i>NME</i>'s Greatest No 1 Singles in History list. In 2004, Houston's version of "I Will Always Love You" placed at number 65 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. It was also ranked at number 22 on <i>The Guardian</i>'s list of Britain's favorite 100 songs, published in May 2002. As of January 2013, Houston's version of "I Will Always Love You" has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling single by a female artist of all time as well as one of the best-selling singles of all time.<br>
<br>
The single's music video is credited to Alan Smithee (Nick Brandt removed his name due to the way Clive Davis re-edited the video), and produced by Rob Newman. It begins with the performance of the song Houston gives at the end of <i>The Bodyguard</i>. The video then cuts to the singer in a dark blue suit sitting in an empty theater with the spotlight shining on her, singing of her love, and when she starts her dramatic vocal finale, the theater changes into open camp surrounded by snow, which is meant to be at Fallen Leaf Lake, California, where <i>The Bodyguard</i>'s boat scene was filmed. The video is interspersed with scenes from the film and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with Houston. At the time of the video's shooting the singer was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina, so she is shown only sitting in the theater scenes. On October 24, 2020, the video for "I Will Always Love You" reached one billion views on YouTube. It is the first music video of the 20th century by a solo artist to reach the milestone. Later in that year the 4k video was released.<br>
