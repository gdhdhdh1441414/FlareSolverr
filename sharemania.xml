So, it's been a while since I've joined this forum, I've always liked to download and keep some of my favorite singers live performances and that's how I ended up here.<br>
I don't know much about all this recording/editing/posting process etc that you guys do so I appreciate the uploaders very much!<br>
<br>
But there are some videos that I have always wanted to edit and cut but I never knew how to do it properly so the video wouldn't lose quality, recently, I've watched some yt tutorials about it and tried to do it with Shotcut, which I found very easy to use and got it done!<br>
<br>
But, I noticed that when I finish editing the video and export the file, it converts my videos to mp4 and they get a little smaller in size, I can't really tell if they lose any quality on image and sound tho.<br>
<br>
So I wondered if you guys know and recommend another software where I can edit/cut the videos and save it as they were before in format, specifications (image, sound, etc)?
