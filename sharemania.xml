THIS IS THE WANT LIST FROM THE IJWTHSTD BLOG, most total long shot but you never know <br>
<br>
<br>
**ETERNAL WANT LIST** <br>
<br>
In this total media universe with everything at my fingertips, individual shows have taken on a lot less importance, however I still want to get my eyes and ears on these.<br>
<br>
This was copied off a much older list where I deleted several found titles so it's not impossible<br>
<br>
I'd say I have plenty to trade but I stopped withholding stuff for those purposes years ago. <br>
<br>
Remember your hoarded recordings are only worth something while there are still people alive who care.<br>
<br>
Therapy? @ Whisky A Go Go Nov 1992 (this was recorded)<br>
Therapy @ The Roxy 5/4/96 (saw this on a list of Westwood One shows, likely never broadcast, can't even find a reference to it now)<br>
The Breeders @ The Casbah 5/12/97 Westwood One saw on same list<br>
GROTUS GENT, BELGIUM<img src="styles/default/xenforo/smilies/exciting-48.png" class="mceSmilie" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D">EMOCRAZ 4/24/94 saw it on a list<br>

THE HANGMEN - anything I don't have <br>
IRON MAIDEN-AUBURN HILLS, MI 1991 PRO VIDEO with sound<br>
BOWIE/NIN-AUBURN HILLS,MI 1995 PRO VIDEO (this exists but was never released, does anyone have the ability to bribe the guy who has it?)<br>
ANTHRAX TROUBADOUR,HOLLYWOOD 5/15/93 **saw this on a list a long time ago, shoulda bought it...<br>
GROTUS SAN FRANCISCO, CA 4/20/92 (they are on the credits of the video of the Mr Bungle headline set so this may exist somewhere)<br>
GROTUS HOUSTON 5/2/96<br>
MELANIE C 2020 webcast<br>
ROLLING STONES New Orleans, LA 7/13/78 video something better than the circulating 20th generation version<br>
