There's a few live performances i saw that exist on prores forums such as "i love you (Live At The Greek Theatre)". But there's other like "The 30th (Live From Singapore's Cloud Forest)" and "Male Fantasy &amp; Lost Cause (Vevo Official Live Performance)" that idk if exist but... in case of the Cloud Forest's performance i have the first part wich is the song "TV" and from the Vevo one, the other songs "Your Power" and "Billie Bossa Nova" were leaked here so if anyone have them or other performances from Billie on ProRes it would be so good!!!
