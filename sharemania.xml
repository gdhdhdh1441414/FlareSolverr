<br>
"<b>Woman in Chains</b>" is a song by English band Tears for Fears, released as the second single from their third studio album, <i>The Seeds of Love</i> (1989). The song prominently features vocals by Oleta Adams, who went on to achieve a successful solo career. The song was an international success, reaching the top 40 in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, France, and the Netherlands.<br>
Phil Collins played drums on this track. Because there are just two members in Tears For Fears, they rely on various guest musicians. When they were working on this song, they envisioned it with "Phil Collins drums." When thinking of who they could get to do it, they thought, <i>how about Phil Collins</i>? "Tears for Fears just wanted me to do that big drum thing from 'In the Air Tonight'..." Collins recalled. "'We want you to come in here in a big way.'"<br>
<br>
"Woman in Chains" is written by Roland Orzabal and was recorded as a duet. During a 2021 interview with the Louder website, when asked if the song is the feminist anthem it’s usually read as, Orzabal replied: "Um... it was really about my mother. At one point in her life she was a stripper. My father and she ran an entertainment agency from a council house in Portsmouth. So she would go out to strip, and my father would send a driver out with her to spy on her. If she talked to another man, when she came back he would beat her up. So it's about domestic abuse."<br>
<br>
Oleta Adams influenced the album before she ever agreed to be on it. While touring the US in support of their previous album, Songs from the Big Chair, the duo watched Adams perform in Kansas City. "We were both knocked out by her emotional power," Orzabal recalled. "She just cut through the intellect and got straight to the heart. It made us realize that all the machinery and the complicatedness we were using were not allowing the expression to come through. It made me go back to the drawing board; it made me want to use real instruments and real soulful vocals."<br>
Adams also joined the group for their The Seeds Of Love tour in 1990.<br>
<br>
The accompanying music video for "Woman in Chains" was directed by Andy Morahan and filmed in black and white. It focuses on the abusive relationship between a man (a boxer) and a woman (a pole-dancer, played by Angela Alvarado); interspersed with shots of the band and guest vocalist Oleta Adams performing the song. It also features Chris Hughes playing the drums.<br>
