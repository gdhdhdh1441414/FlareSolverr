"<b>I Wanna Dance with Somebody</b>", also known as "<b>I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)</b>", is a song recorded by American singer Whitney Houston for her second studio album, <i>Whitney</i> (1987). It was released as the lead single from the album on May 2, 1987, by Arista Records. It was produced by Narada Michael Walden, and written by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, of the band Boy Meets Girl, who had previously collaborated with Houston on "How Will I Know."<br>
<br>
"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)" received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised Houston's vocal performance but critiqued its musical arrangement comparing it to "How Will I Know" and Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want to Have Fun." Despite the mixed critical response, the song became a worldwide success, topping the charts in eighteen countries including Australia, Italy, Germany and the UK. In the US, it became Houston's fourth consecutive chart topper and is certified 6× platinum with sales of over 6 million equivalent copies.<br>
At the 30th Annual Grammy Awards, "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)" won for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, marking Houston's second win in the category.<br>
<br>
The music video was directed by Brian Grant and choreographed by Arlene Phillips, who also worked with Houston on the music video for "How Will I Know". It played on MTV in heavy rotation. The video features Houston in a purple dress and a continuous shot of a purple backdrop that never changes its angle of vision. In the intro of this video, Houston just finishes a performance onstage. She walks backstage, and the scene is intercut with more vivid, colorful images of her. The song then explodes into its beginning, with myriad locations and various outfits by Houston, as dancers trying to impress her as she dances. Towards the end of the song she manhandles a guy, who has a mixture of a look of shock and surprise asking him "Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance".<br>
<br>
The video was remastered in 4K to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the release of the <i>Whitney</i> album and it has over 399 million views as of May 2023 on YouTube, making it the fifth most watched music video by a female artist released in the 1980s behind Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time", Madonna's "La Isla Bonita", Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart" and Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" respectively.<br>
