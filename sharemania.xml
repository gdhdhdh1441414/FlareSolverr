<span style="font-size: 18px"><b>ALBUM REVIEW</b></span><br>
The Dark Side of the Moon was a benchmark record. It turned the musical world on its ear with a hitherto unheard combination of sounds, and changed things considerably for Pink Floyd. For this project, the band resurrected older and unfinished numbers, some of which came from the multitude of soundtracks the bandmembers had previously worked on. The film Zabriskie Point, a study of American materialism from a foreigner's perspective, provided "Us and Them" (originally titled "The Violence Sequence"). Waters rewrote "Breathe" after its appearance on his and avant-garde composer Ron Geesin's score for The Body, a surreal medical documentary. Floyd and their longtime engineer, Alan Parsons, used a multitude of sound effects, from stereophonically projected footsteps and planes flying overhead ("On the Run") to a roomful of ringing clocks ("Time"). Further adding to the record's mystique, barely audible spoken passages were sprinkled throughout; a result of hours of interviews of random Abbey Road occupants about their views on insanity, violence, and death. Floyd must have struck a nerve: The Dark Side of the Moon remained on Billboard's albums chart for an astounding 14 years. It made Pink Floyd a household name, elevating them to the level of the Rolling Stones and the Who in the rock pantheon.<br>
