"<b>Zombie</b>" is a protest song by Irish alternative rock band the Cranberries, written by the band's lead singer Dolores O'Riordan in memory of Johnathan Ball (3) and Tim Parry (12), who were killed in the 1993 Warrington bombings. It was released on 19 September 1994 as the lead single from their second studio album, <i>No Need to Argue</i>, two weeks ahead of the album's release. Music critics have long recognised "Zombie" as "a masterpiece of alternative rock", as well as a grunge number uncharacteristic of the band's other work.<br>
<br>
During the Troubles, more than 3,500 people died and tens of thousands were injured in more than 30 years of the complex and often brutal conflict. The IRA, which was devoted both to removing British forces from Northern Ireland and to unifying Ireland, killed almost 2,000 people during this time. During this time, over 10,000 bomb attacks were perpetrated in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and England, in an armed conflict fought between the Provisional IRA, the Ulster loyalist paramilitaries, and the British security forces. The song was written in response to the death of Johnathan Ball, 3, and Tim Parry, 12, who had been killed in the IRA bombing in Warrington, northwest England, when two devices hidden in litter bins were detonated. Ball died at the scene of the bombing as a result of his shrapnel-inflicted injuries and, five days later, Parry lost his life as a result of head injuries. 56 others were injured, some seriously. Parry died in his father's arms in Liverpool's Walton hospital. The two boys had gone shopping to buy Mother's Day cards on one of the town's busiest shopping streets.<br>
<br>
"Zombie" reached No. 1 on the charts of Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, and Iceland, as well as on the US <i>Billboard</i> Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was voted by Australian radio Triple J listeners as No. 1 on the 1994 Triple J Hottest 100 chart. It won the Best Song Award at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards.<br>
<br>
The music video was directed by Samuel Bayer, and produced by Doug Friedman and HSI. Productions. It was filmed in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the heart of the Troubles with real footage, and in Dublin. Bayer's argument for being able to record video footage of murals, children and soldiers on patrol in Belfast was made under a false pretext. "We had a [cover] story that we were making a documentary about the peace-keeping efforts in Ireland", he said. O'Riordan remembered Bayer telling her "how tense it was and how he was blown away by the whole thing. He got footage of the kids jumping from one building to another, and he got a lot of footage of the army. He was a very good director". The performance footage in colour was filmed on a sound stage in Los Angeles over a period of six days.<br>
<br>
On 18 April 2020, the official music video had succeeded in reaching over 1 billion views on YouTube and became the first female-led song, first song by an Irish artist, and sixth song from the 20th century to reach the milestone. Bassist Mike Hogan said of the achievement that <i>"I can still remember making such a great video and seeing the impact that it had – and still does – on people".</i><br>
In celebration of Zombie hitting a billion views, the video has been restored to 4K. On 20 April 2020, 4K remaster was officially released for YouTube with previously unseen footage from the original video shoot.<br>
<br>
