"<b>Come and Get Your Love</b>" is a song by American rock band Redbone. Redbone is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1969 by brothers Pat and Lolly Vegas. All members during their commercial peak and success were of Mexican American and Native American heritage, which was heavily reflected in their songs, stage costumes, and album art. The song was originally released as a promo track under the name "<b>Hail</b>" and was later featured on their fifth album, <i>Wovoka</i> (1973), under its current name. The song was released as the album's first single the following year. Written and produced by band members Pat and Lolly Vegas, it is one of the band's most successful singles. It made them the first Native American band to reach the top five on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, reaching number five. The song later appeared on many "greatest hits" albums released by the band, as well as on numerous compilation albums of the 1970s.<br>
<br>
The single cut is significantly shorter, with the album version featuring an introductory slow part, plus a longer repeated coda. Most radio stations rarely play the latter. The song features a prominent part for electric sitar. A shorter DJ re-service edit of the single version is mainly distinguished by a lead vocal. During sportscaster George Michael's tenure as a disc jockey on New York's WABC radio from September 1974 to November 1979, he would routinely begin his Friday night show with this song, which he dubbed the "weekend national anthem".<br>
<br>
The song peaked at number five on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart on April 13, 1974. It spent 18 weeks in the Top 40 and landed as the fourth-most popular song on the Hot 100 for 1974. The single was certified gold by the RIAA on April 22, 1974, which indicates that it had shipped over a million copies in North America. The song is Redbone's highest charting single and one of two Top 40 hits by the band. (An earlier recording, "The Witch Queen of New Orleans," peaked at number 21 in 1972.)<br>
<br>
In France, the single peaked at number 177 on the singles sales chart (physical sales + downloads) in 2017. The following year, Redbone's version featured in a Christmas 2018 media advertising campaign from Bouygues, the French telecommunications company, and the song soon rose to the top of the pop charts. It entered the downloads chart's Top 10, and reached number one on the singles sales chart at the end of the year. It also peaked at number 20 on the singles chart (downloads plus streaming) during the last week of the year.<br>
<br>
In 2014, "Come and Get Your Love" experienced a resurgence in popularity when it was featured in the Marvel Studios film <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> as one of the songs on a mixtape made for the protagonist Peter Quill. It was also included on the film's soundtrack album, which reached the top spot on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. It was later heard and reused in the MCU films <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>, from 2019 and 2023 respectively.<br>
<br>
A music video was released in 2020. The music video chronicles the experiences of a spiritual traveler who leaves home to explore a new world, and offers a look into the living and changing culture of Native America in the 21st Century. The film reexamines pop-culture imagery in the context of contemporary events, and is inspired by a variety of sources, from graffiti to magical realism, mixing reality with the fantastic, the past with the future.<br>
