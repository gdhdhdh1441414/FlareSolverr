Lyrics : [00:07.58]We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain / [00:11.62]We jumped, never asking why / [00:15.62]We kissed, I fell under your spell / [00:19.43]A love no one could deny / [00:24.18]Don't you ever say I just walked away / [00:28.23]I will always want you / [00:32.00]I can't live a lie, running for my life / [00:36.52]I will always want you / [00:40.73]I came in like a wrecking ball / [00:45.08]I never hit so hard in love / [00:48.77]All I wanted was to break your walls / [00:52.75]All you ever did was wreck me / [00:57.69]Yeah, you, you wreck me / [01:01.63]I put you high up in the sky / [01:05.77]And now, you're not coming down / [01:09.56]It slowly turned, you let me burn / [01:13.65]And now, we're ashes on the ground / [01:18.13]Don't you ever say I just walked away / [01:22.05]I will always want you / [01:25.94]I can't live a lie, running for my life / [01:30.20]I will always want you / [01:32.96]I came in like a wrecking ball / [01:36.57]I never hit so hard in love / [01:40.51]All I wanted was to break your walls / [01:44.88]All you ever did was wreck me / [01:48.95]I came in like a wrecking ball / [01:52.91]Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung / [01:56.73]Left me crashing in a blazin' fall / [02:00.71]All you ever did was wreck me / [02:05.67]Yeah, you, you wreck me / [02:11.99]I never meant to start a war / [02:15.79]I just wanted you to let me in / [02:20.19]And instead of using force / [02:24.02]I guess I should've let you in / [02:28.03]I never meant to start a war / [02:31.49]I just wanted you to let me in / [02:35.75]I guess I should've let you in / [02:42.14]Don't you ever say I just walked away / [02:46.30]I will always want you / [02:50.99]I came in like a wrecking ball / [02:54.92]I never hit so hard in love / [02:58.68]All I wanted was to break your walls / [03:02.65]All you ever did was wreck me / [03:06.72]I came in like a wrecking ball / [03:10.81]Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung / [03:14.62]Left me crashing in a blazin' fall / [03:18.69]All you ever did was wreck me / [03:23.47]Yeah, you, you wreck me / [03:27.65]Yeah, you, you wreck me / [03:31.12]
