The Music Never Stopped</i> is an extended play project by American singer <b>Aaron Carter</b>, independently and exclusively released on SoundCloud on February 24, 2015. The project marked his first music release in thirteen years, following <i>Another Earthquake</i> (2002) As the title implies, Carter sought to silence critics and naysayers about the status of his music career.<br>
<br>
The song "Let Go" was written by Carter to express his continued love for fellow entertainer Hilary Duff, who he briefly dated as a teenager. He would go on to release Love in 2018, his last major label studio album prior to his 2022 death.<br>
<br>
<i><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note</span>: Before anyone asks or checks the files for "validity" - which is f*cking rude, btw - this album was never released on CD or other streaming platforms. The M4As were directly taken from the SoundCloud streams. If this isn't your bag, feel free to move on.<br>
