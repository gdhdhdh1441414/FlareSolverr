"<b>You Should See Me in a Crown</b>" is a song by American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish and the lead single of her debut studio album, <i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i> (2019). It was released on July 18, 2018, through Darkroom and Interscope Records. It was written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, who also produced the track. The song received positive reviews and charted in countries including the US, Canada and Australia.<br>
<br>
The song's title was inspired by a scene from the third episode of the second season of BBC television series <i>Sherlock</i> titled "The Reichenbach Fall", where the villain Jim Moriarty says the line "Honey, you should see me in a crown". Eilish and O'Connell, who are fans of the series, thought that the line was "dope" and decided to write a song around the quote. The song "Human" by Iranian-Dutch singer Sevdaliza was also cited as one of the track's influences.<br>
<br>
A vertical music video for the track was released in August 2018 featuring Eilish covered in spiders as she sings the song. Eilish cited a woman called "Diana" as an inspiration for the video, saying of her: "She showed me how she puts the spider in her mouth, and then I did it. Spiders on my face and hair...I loved it." The vertical video was later released as a full-screen video, albeit with the same recording and audio.<br>
<br>
In March 2019, Eilish released the official music video for the track, directed and animated by Takashi Murakami, with whom she had previously collaborated for the cover of Garage Magazine, on Apple Music, before posting it to YouTube the following month. Murakami stated in a press release that the anime-style video, which was animated using motion capture technology, took eight months for him to create. The video opens with an animated version of Eilish, dressed in a neon-green shirt and shorts. This modified Eilish tries on a black spider hoodie and eventually morphs into a spider-like monster that wreaks havoc on a miniature city. The video features the first appearance of the "Blohsh," Eilish's signature logo, as well as Murakami's flowers.<br>
<br>
<b>Release Info</b><br>
