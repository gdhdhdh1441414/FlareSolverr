1080p please. The 5.1 audio can be optional, but I would really like the quality to match the other uploads available here.<br>
<br>
It would be awesome if the other languages were included, but English is preferred.<br>
<br>
From what I can find it isn't available in the US, but should be in the UK and in France on Disney+.<br>
<br>
I searched the forum and both threads didn't have this episode. I searched online and only iffy quality video with watermarks was out there. I searched various torrents sites too. I really tried with my existing knowledge...<br>
<br>
I know it's a long shot and a big ask, but please help if you're able to get it. Thank you!
