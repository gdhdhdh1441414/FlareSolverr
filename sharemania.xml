<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Info for <i>The Road Well Travelled</i></b></span><br>
<br>
<br>
I took the road well travelled like many a travelling troubadour before me; Jack Kerouac, Woody Guthrie, the great writer Laurie Lee, who walked to Spain from a small village in England in the 1930’s, playing his violin along the way, and Knulp, in the novel by Hermann Hesse, and many more long gone and forgotten. The songs I’ve written during the last fifty-five years of my life on the road have been inspired by the wonderful places I’ve seen, and the people I’ve met.<br>
<br>
This album, like the others that came before it, is a collection of experiences from life on the road. Recorded in the world famous Stockfisch studios in Northeim, Germany by Günter Pauler and his team I am pleased to present this new Album to my audience throughout the various countries I have travelled. Accompanied by some fine musicians in the studio, the songs reflect the solitary thoughts of a troubadour forever heading towards the next horizon. With a fond farewell to times past, and the hope of a peaceful future, I hope you, my fellow travellers through the joys and sadness of life, will find some comfort and share some dreams from this collection of my songs. (Allan Taylor)<br>
<br>
Allan Taylor's years "On the Road" are in the past. The songwriter, singer and guitarist has retired from concert touring. At most, there may still be a few selected appearances. What remains are his songs, which tell of encounters and impressions on the road. For over 50 years now, Allan Taylor has been able to put his experiences and thoughts into words and sensitively shape them musically.<br>
<br>
He has achieved this once again on his new album "The Road Well Travelled", recorded and atmospherically arranged like all his productions released on the Northeim Stockfisch label for almost 30 years.<br>
<br>
In eight song gems, Allan Taylor looks back on his artistic career from the important folk clubs in England, his time in New York City, tours through America and performances in many other countries. The memories in the songs of the new production begin with "The Last Train". In "A Giant Red Balloon", the path leads far back into his youth. "The Joker's Hand" is an impressive duet with his young Danish colleague Jacob Dinesen.<br>
<br>
In the concluding title track, "The Road Well Travelled", Allan Taylor takes a journey through his entire artistic life with touching spoken word vocals and sparse piano accompaniment. This great singer &amp; songwriter has delivered a mature résumé here. An album that his fans will love and that could draw the attention of newcomers to his extensive oeuvre. (Klaus Hoheisel)<br>
