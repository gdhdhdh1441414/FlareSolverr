YouTube personality Jacob Matthew "Jakey" Christensen, better known by his YouTube channel name, NakeyJakey, has been producing music since late 2015 with his first ever song titled "10K" being uploaded on both his channel and SoundCloud account on September 16, 2016. After several years of running a successful video game review channel and while still putting out viral tracks on the side such as "South Dakota" and "Saintlike", Christensen announced an upcoming debut album titled ROMCOM on December 21, 2019. Initially slated for February 2022 as a tentative release month, difficulties with solo producing an entire album for the first time delayed its release until November 18, 2022. Heavily influenced by SoundCloud rap, mainstream hip-hop, as well as his favorite childhood media, ROMCOM delivers a personal story about the artist dealing with and overcoming depression and dives into his social anxiety related to being a public figure and performer. The lyrics are delivered over sample-heavy beats that utilize a lot of nostalgic and recognizable soundbites.<br>
