<blockquote class="quoteContainer"><div class="quote">Britney Jean is the eighth studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on November 29, 2013, by RCA Records. The album is Spears's second eponymous record after Britney (2001), though the album's name refers to both her first and middle names. It marks Spears's first major activity since the dissolution of her longtime record label, Jive Records, in 2011. The singer began recording material for Britney Jean in May 2013, eventually continuing into October of that year. On numerous occasions, Spears has described the album as the most personal record from her catalog. Having assumed an integral position in its production, she co-wrote each track and collaborated with songwriters and producers including Sia and will.i.am to achieve her desired sound. Furthermore, the record features guest vocals from Spears's younger sister Jamie Lynn, T.I., and will.i.am. Musically, Britney Jean contains strong elements of EDM and pop.<br>
<br>
Upon its release, Britney Jean received mixed reviews from music critics, who felt the album was impersonal despite its marketing, and were ambivalent towards its dated production. The album drew controversy over the authenticity of some vocals. The record debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies. In doing so, it became Spears' lowest-peaking and lowest-selling record in the United States. The same happened in the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number 34; worldwide, Britney Jean reached the top 20 and top 30 in most countries. The album was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined album-equivalent units of 500,000.<br>
<br>
"Work Bitch" was released as the lead single from Britney Jean on September 17, 2013. The track debuted and peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was a moderate success worldwide, later becoming one of her signature songs. "Perfume" was released as the second single from the album on November 3, 2013, and peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100. "Til It's Gone" impacted French radio on December 4, 2013, and "It Should Be Easy" impacted Italian radio on June 13, 2014, as the third and fourth single from the album, respectively. No further promotion was done for the record, a situation which was reported in the media. However, Spears appeared on Good Morning America on September 17, 2013, to announce a two-year (eventually extended to four years) residency show at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas, titled Britney: Piece of Me, which began on December 27, 2013, and concluded on December 31, 2017.</div><div class="quoteExpand quoteCut">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>
