Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
Perhaps anyone who has a copy of the 2022 Plastic Pop release of Sophie Ellis-Bextor's album "Trip the Light Fantastic" could share the song "Here's to You" in good quality (or if it's not a hassle, maybe all the bonus tracks). I would buy the CD myself, but I unfortunately live in Asia and shipping's kind of insane. <br>
<br>
All copies of this song on the internet are low quality vinyl rips. There was a WAV link on a different thread, but it's not working anymore.
