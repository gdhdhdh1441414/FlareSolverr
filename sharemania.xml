"<b>Planet Jarre 5.1</b>" is a part of the "Planet Jarre: 50 Years of Music" compilation album by French electronic musician and composer Jean-Michel Jarre, released on 14 September 2018 to commemorate Jarre's 50 years in the music business. All tracks have been hand-picked, remastered and retouched by Jarre himself.<br>
<br>
Jean-Michel Jarre is a pioneer in the electronic, ambient and new-age genres. His first mainstream success was the 1976 album Oxygène. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well-known as a performer as he is as a musician.<br>
<br>
Planet Jarre has become a nice overview of his extensive career. It contains songs or parts of almost all his albums.<br>
The 4LP vinyl and 2CD+2MC box sets come with a download card to "enter the world of Jean-Michel Jarre in 5.1". The download contains the whole album as WAV files, a video introduction from Jean-Michel Jarre and 12 mp4 files with Dolby Digital Plus (Enhanced AC-3) audio tracks.<br>
<br>
<b>Tracklist</b><br>
01. Circus (with Siriusmo) (3:11)<br>
02. Equinoxe 2 (5:02)<br>
03. Equinoxe 5 (3:47)<br>

<br>
<b>Release Info</b><br>
These tracks are part of the Vinyl Box Set of Planet Jarre. It contains a download card with a code to download the exclusive 5.1 content. The mp4 files contain a static backdrop and a 5.1 Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC3) track. I've muxed the audio track from the mp4 files to m4a with MP4Box and added a cover. The cover is created by merging the text from the backdrop with the cover from Planet Jarre.<br>
