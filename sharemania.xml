I am looking for what I think is the Demo of "It's So Cool" or a finished unreleased version. I think it is the version that the Paul Oakenfold mix that was included on Celebration was based from, as the vocal sounds the same. It doesn't have the club mix sound it's more electro popI have it mp3 but want it lossless, so I'm hoping someone can help me out as I love this version it runs 3:30 not 3:27 like the Oakenfold mix. This is not the early version with Lola that was recorded for American Life but I would like the lola version in lossless as well. I really with this song would have been released.
