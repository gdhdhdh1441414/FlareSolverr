"<b>Thank You</b>" is a song written and performed by English singer-songwriter Dido. The song made its first appearance in 1998 on the soundtrack of the movie <i>Sliding Doors.</i> It was later included on Dido's 1999 debut album, <i>No Angel</i>, released in September 2000. The same year, American rapper Eminem sampled the track for his hit single "Stan", which helped propel "Thank You" and <i>No Angel</i> to mainstream success.<br>
<br>
Dido wrote "Thank You" after meeting her boyfriend, a lawyer named Bob Page, in 1995 and falling for him hard. Her tea has gone cold and the rain has clouded her window, but seeing his picture on her wall reminds her that it's not so bad.<br>
In this song, she thanks Page for giving her the "best day of her life," which is when they met in a club and had their first encounter. Page sparked a creative fire in Dido, who also wrote the song "Here With Me" about him. They got engaged in 2001, but broke up a year later, inspiring another Dido song: "White Flag."<br>
<br>
Entering the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 at number 80 in January 2001, "Thank You" peaked at number three in April 2001. It held that spot for three weeks and became Dido's first and only top-10 single in the United States. Additionally, the song reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Adult Contemporary, Adult Pop Songs, and Hot Dance Club Songs charts. In the United Kingdom, "Thank You" also reached number three, becoming the singer's third top-five single in the UK.<br>
"Thank You" won Song of the Year at the 2002 ASCAP awards, honoring it as the most successful song of the previous year. ASCAP represents songwriters and makes sure their members get paid when their songs are performed. The award indicates that this song was constantly played on the radio and used in other media where performance rights had to be paid.<br>
<br>
The music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was released in January 2001. In the video, Dido has not paid her bills, and the government comes to tear down her house. The police put an eviction notice on her door and movers start moving her belongings out. During the first chorus of the song, Dido has a cup of tea whilst movers pile her belongings by an outside wall, and a mover steps on flowers in her front yard. In the end, she is escorted out of her home, her home is demolished, she leaves behind most of her belongings, and walks away with just her shoulder bag, an umbrella, and a hair dryer.<br>
The end of the video implies that her house is actually being torn down for redevelopment, as her home is sandwiched between two large skyscrapers.<br>
<br>
<b>Release Info</b><br>
