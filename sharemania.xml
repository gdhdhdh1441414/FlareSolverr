"<b>Don't Give Up</b>" is a song written by English rock musician Peter Gabriel and recorded as a duet with English singer Kate Bush for Gabriel's fifth solo studio album <i>So</i> (1986). The single version was released as the second single from the album in the UK in 1986 and as the fifth single in the US in 1987.<br>
<br>
The song was inspired by the Depression-era photographs of Dorothea Lange, showing poverty-stricken Americans in Dust Bowl conditions. Gabriel saw Lange's images in a book entitled <i>In This Proud Land</i> (1973). He felt that a song based on this was appropriate to difficult economic conditions in the United Kingdom under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. He composed lyrics about a man whose unemployment causes stress in his domestic relationship. The verses, sung by Gabriel, describe the man's feelings of isolation, loneliness and despair; the choruses, sung by Bush, offer words of hope and encouragement.<br>
<br>
The song was covered by American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, American singer-songwriter Pink and American singer-songwriter John Legend in 2010 and was released as track #2 on <i>The Imagine Project</i>.<br>
The Imagine Project is the forty-sixth and latest studio album by Herbie Hancock released on June 22, 2010. The album, which was recorded in many locations throughout the world and features collaborations with various artists, was complemented by a documentary about the recording process. Hancock's interpretations of these songs are cross-cultural. It was released in CD, digital download and vinyl.<br>
