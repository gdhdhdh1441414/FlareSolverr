"<b>Come Together</b>" is a cover of the 1969 song of the same name by The Beatles recorded by American blues guitarist and singer Gary Clark Jr. and Dutch composer, multi-instrumentalist, DJ, producer, and engineer Junkie XL for the soundtrack of the DC Extended Universe film <i>Justice League</i>. It was released as a single on September 8, 2017.<br>
<br>
Gary Clark Jr. had never so much as considered covering the Beatles’ “Come Together” until he was approached to play on a version of it for the <i>Justice League </i>soundtrack. It ended up being the most fun Clark has ever had in the studio. “I don’t know what ‘toe-jam football’ is, but I’ll sing the shit out of it,” he nonchalantly tells <i>Rolling Stone</i>. “I printed out the lyrics and I went for it.”<br>
<br>
The recording is a freewheeling electro-rock crossover that features Clark playing his signature bluesy guitar licks around Junkie XL’s stomping, bass-heavy refiguring of the Beatles riff. Fittingly, Clark’s vocal performance grooves up slowly, and he commands a wailing guitar solo at the end that’s been evolving on the road since he left the recording studio. There’s even a six-minute extended version of the tune with <i>more </i>guitar.<br>
<br>
Clark says he was wholly unaware of Junkie XL, who’s best known for his remix of Elvis Presley’s “A Little Less Conversation” and comic-book move soundtracks, before they met. The producer simply showed Clark some videos of him performing before broaching the subject at hand: playing over what Clark describes as Junkie XL’s “industrial, raw, futuristic-type shit” in “Come Together.” “He said, ‘I think you would be the guy to do this thing some sort of justice,'” Clark recalls. “Then he said, ‘You know that fuzzy guitar shit that you do?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah.’ And he was like, ‘Just do that.’ Then I put the guitar over my shoulder and just let loose.”<br>
<br>
“It was like being in a garage band again, just 15-year-old kids making noise,” Clark adds. “The last time I felt that I was in a session with Alicia Keys. It was incredible. It just depends on who you work with and what kind of energy they bring. We left, and I was like, ‘Man, we got to do this again.'”<br>
