“<b><span style="font-size: 12px">AUSTIN</span></b>” is the fifth studio album by American rapper and singer Post Malone. It is released through Mercury Records and Republic Records on July 28, 2023. Production on the album was handled by Malone himself, Andrew Watt, Louis Bell, Max Martin, and Rami Yacoub. It was supported by three singles: "Chemical", "Mourning", and "Overdrive". The album is Malone's first project to not feature any guest appearances.<br>
<br>
On April 14, 2023, Malone released the lead single of the album, "Chemical". On May 15, he posted an Instagram video to announce the record by saying: "I wanted to tell you guys that I have an album coming out this summer on July 28. It's called <i>Austin</i>". The album is titled after his real first name. The message hinted at a different artistic approach, possibly intensifying the sound of his fourth studio album, <i>Twelve Carat Toothache</i> (2022). Malone revealed that he played the guitar on every single song on the album, calling the creation process a "fun experience". He described the outcome as the "most challenging and rewarding music" he had ever made, which was a product of constantly pushing himself. That same day, Malone also announced a summer North American tour called the “If Ya'll Weren't Here, I'd Be Crying Tour” to accompany the release of the album, which later became a world tour that started on July 8 and will end on December 3. The second single of the album, "Mourning", was released on May 19, four days later. The third and final single, "Overdrive", was released on July 14, 2023.<br>
