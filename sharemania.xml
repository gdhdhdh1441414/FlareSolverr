"<b>Weapon of Choice</b>" is a song by English big beat musician Fatboy Slim from his third studio album, <i>Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars</i>. It features American funk musician Bootsy Collins. It was released as a double A-side single with "Star 69" on 23 April 2001, as well as a standalone single release, and a 2010 re-release with remixes. The single peaked at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart.<br>
<br>
"Weapon of Choice" features a lead vocal by Bootsy Collins, known as a member of the funk group Parliament-Funkadelic and leader of Bootsy's Rubber Band. On the album version, Collins's normal vocals are heard through the right audio channel; the same vocals, distorted to a much deeper pitch, are heard through the left. The song features a prominent sample of Sly &amp; the Family Stone's 1968 song "Into My Own Thing", as well as samples from "All Strung Out Over You" by The Chambers Brothers and "Word Play" by The X-Ecutioners, the latter of which was previously sampled on another Fatboy Slim song, "Don't Forget Your Teeth", the B-side to his single "Right Here, Right Now", and "Gangster Trippin".<br>
<br>
The chorus of the song, "You could blow with this, or you could blow with that", is an homage to the Black Sheep song "The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)", which has a similar chorus. The lines "Walk without rhythm/and it won't attract the worm" quote the science fiction novel <i>Dune</i>, while the line "tone of my voice" may be the titular weapon, as used by some of the book's characters. The line "halfway between the gutter and the stars" refers to a line in Oscar Wilde's play <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i>: "We are all of us in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars", and was also used as the album title.<br>
<br>
The music video was filmed in the lobby of the Marriott Hotel (now the L.A. Grand Hotel Downtown) in Los Angeles in December 2000. Directed by Spike Jonze, it features actor Christopher Walken, who trained as a dancer in musical theatre before his acting career. Walken had asked Jonze to film his dancing, and Jonze suggested that he participate in the video. Fatboy Slim had originally been scheduled to have a cameo in the video, replacing Walken in the harness shots, but was unavailable that weekend because his wife, Zoe Ball, was giving birth.<br>
<br>
In the video, Walken is relaxing in a chair in a deserted hotel lobby, when he hears the song being played from a cleaning cart nearby. He begins to dance around the hotel, then gets in an elevator, leaps off the balcony, and flies around the mezzanine before returning to the chair and sitting back down.<br>
<br>
The "Weapon of Choice" video won six awards at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards and won the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Music Video. Walken was awarded one of MTV's "Moonmen" for Best Choreography. The clip was also ranked number one in a list of the top 100 videos of all time by VH1 in April 2002 compiled from a music industry survey.<br>
<br>
Walken has cited admiration for Jonze as one of his main reasons for appearing in the video, which he also welcomed as a chance to do "something different". He also noted that as a trained tap dancer, dancing to electronic music suited him well.<br>
<br>
To mark the track's 20th anniversary, the video has been lovingly - and painstakingly - restored from the original 35mm film to produce this truly stunning 4k version that befits one of the greatest music videos of all-time (description @ YouTube).<br>
<br>
<b>Release Info</b><br>
Sadly the 4K remaster is only released on YouTube. Tidal and Apple Music still stream the SD version. :/<br>
<b>Note:</b> This release contains 2 versions: One with the original VP9 track, downloaded from YouTube and one converted to HEVC 10-bit. The PCM track is lossless (16-bit 48 kHz), synced with Adobe Audition.<br>
