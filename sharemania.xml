Hello everyone,<br>
As a French fan of Doctor Who, I don't have access to BBC iPlayer and even with a VPN it doesn't work...<br>
I know I'm going to ask a lot <img src="styles/default/xenforo/smilies/shame-48.png" class="mceSmilie" alt=":oops:" title="Oops!    :oops:"><br>
Could anyone help me recover the following videos with subtitles (.srt) ?<br>
