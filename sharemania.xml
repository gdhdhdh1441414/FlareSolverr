"<b>Rude</b>" is the debut single by Canadian band Magic! from their debut studio album, <i>Don't Kill the Magic</i>. It was originally released on October 11, 2013, as a promotional single and then re-released on February 24, 2014, by Sony Music Entertainment. The official remix for the song features Kid Ink and Ty Dolla Sign, with Blink-182 member Travis Barker on the drums.<br>
<br>
"Rude" was an international commercial success amidst mixed reception from music critics. The song peaked at number six on the Canadian Hot 100 and internationally topped the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden. "Rude" was the ninth best-selling song of 2014, with global sales of 8.6 million units, and won the Juno Award for Single of the Year.<br>
<br>
"Rude" was written by Nasri, Adam Messinger, Mark Pellizzer, Ben Spivak, and Alex Tanas, and produced by Adam Messinger. It was named after the reggae term "rude boy" and originally based on a real-life situation. The lead singer of Magic!, Nasri, had been in an unhealthy relationship with a previous girlfriend. After the two of them got into a fight with each other, the band based the song off that headline. The couple was in a "mean time" when they were both being rude to each other, as Nasri says in what he describes as a "dark vibe".<br>
<br>
The music video was filmed in November 2013, directed by David Rousseau. It features the band singing the song in a garage while scenes show Nasri in a relationship with a woman played by model Ayla Parker. After this, Nasri asks her conservative father, played by actor Brian Knudson, for her hand in marriage, but the father refuses and won't explain why. The mother, played by actress Mary Kay McCartney, is somewhat softer. Eventually, Nasri secretly proposes to her and together with the rest of the band, try to convince the father, but he still refuses. Nasri marries her anyway and all party in the garage as Parker proclaims her love for Nasri and she abandons her overprotective father's house once and for all. The video was released on the band's YouTube account on December 5, 2013. As of January 2023, the video has over 2.3 billion views on YouTube, and is one of the top 70 most viewed videos on the site.<br>
