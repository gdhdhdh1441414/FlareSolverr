"<b>Reflections</b>" is the fourth studio album by German music producer and DJ Paul van Dyk. It was released on 7 October 2003 by Urban Records, Positiva Records and Mute Records. Matthias Paul; born 16 December 1971), known professionally as Paul van Dyk is a German DJ, record producer and musician. Van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release <i>Reflections</i>. He was the first DJ to be named number one by <i>Mixmag</i> in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide.<br>
<br>
As a trance producer starting in the early 1990s, van Dyk quickly achieved popularity with his remix of "Love Stimulation" by Humate on the record label MFS in 1993 and with his hit single "For an Angel". Van Dyk is an avid trance lover to this day. He indicated in an interview that he ended up giving himself the Belgian-sounding stage name because he used to incorporate many Belgian dance records into his DJ sets in the early 1990s.<br>
<br>
"Every single piece of music I've ever done has its own little story and history behind it," said van Dyk in an interview in 2003. "There is always a reason why a track is a certain way. This is so important for me in this world, especially with this album." Van Dyk wrote most of the lyrics (included inside the album) for specific tracks, and this fact alone sets "Reflections" apart from other albums that merely lay vocals over existing instrumental tracks.<br>
<br>
"In my music, it's important for me to be as honest and direct and intense as much as I can," said van Dyk in the previously noted interview. "The big step forward, and what makes this album different from previous ones, is the fact that I'm much more aware of some sort of responsibility we have for what's going on on this planet. I tried to incorporate it into the songs in terms of what a song is actually saying.I've never been as outspoken, and I don't think many dance albums actually ever care about what's going on in that respect."<br>
