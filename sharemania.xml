Looking for Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction Seasons 1-4. I know for sure the US region of Amazon has the entire series, 1-4 from 1997-2002.<br>
<br>
The show was shot and formatted for Dolby 5.1 surround as well although I'm not sure if it ever actually aired in this multi channel setup back when the show was on cable or if it was just mastered with 5.1. I'm not sure if the first season has it or not but I'm sure from 2 or perhaps 3, onwards, it was listed in the closing credits as featuring 5.1 surround.<br>
<br>
The Amazon versions are all 2.0 for some odd reason. Perhaps the distributors could only source stereo for some reason and this was the only version Amazon received?<br>
<br>
Someone had previously uploaded all four seasons on here a few years ago but for some reason, the uploaded removed them from their drive.<br>
<br>
Anyone else on here have the previously uploaded versions or their own rips?<br>
<br>
Would be a huge help.<br>
<br>
Regards.
