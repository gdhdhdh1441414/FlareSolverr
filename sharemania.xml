<br>
so, I went to my local movie theater yesterday, to enjoy this masterpiece,<br>
and to my surprise (not really), I had the full room for my own enjoyment and company<br>
<br>
instead of screaming my heart out, sharing friendship bracelets<br>
and dancing my feet off with other swifties (like I dreamed I would)<br>
I found myself recording the audio of the full concert film to share it with you all!<br>
<br>
it was nice, really. I couldn't stop myself from (silently) crying when she played YOYOK<br>
it felt like having my own private concert<br>
<br>
I am not an audio engineer or something, and this was recorded with my iPhone,<br>
so don't expect HQ audio. I tried my best, tho<br>
at times, at certain songs, the audio feels a little muffled<br>
<br>
I'm hoping this will be officially released within the following weeks<br>
for the time being... this is the best I could do<br>
<br>
<b>please, comment/reply with the one song you would have loved <br>
to be included on the setlist!</b><br>
<br>
thanks, guys!<br>
