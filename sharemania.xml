To all collectors who have the “Risk / Close To You” vinyl, please rip “Close To You” like what happened with “Sweeter Than Fiction (Taylor’s Version)” which was successful, I just wonder if we could do the same with “Close To You” since some people already have the vinyl containing the song. Thank you in advance!

"<b>Lose Control</b>" is a song by American singer-songwriter Teddy Swims, released on June 23, 2023, as the second single from his debut studio album <i>I've Tried Everything but Therapy (Part 1)</i> (2023). Produced by Ammo and Julian Bunetta, it is Swims's first song to reach the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, debuting at number 99 and peaking at number one in March 2024. It also topped the charts in Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Iceland.<br>
<br>
In February, during a writing camp in Palm Springs, Calif., singer-songwriter Teddy Swims had a professional breakthrough — amid a period of personal turmoil, following a breakup. <i>“I was so unhinged at the time,”</i> he remembers. <i>“I just needed to say a lot of stuff.”</i> Over the course of five days, he poured his emotions into half of the songs that would ultimately comprise his debut album, including his biggest hit to date, "Lose Control."<br>
<br>
Rooted in piano-driven production — and an impressive ability to stretch his vocal runs — the R&amp;B-pop ballad details a relationship that’s been tainted by substance abuse. <i>“Being in love can be like an addiction sometimes — always chasing the highs from the lows. It's about losing yourself and losing control when it all starts to cave in and thinking that the only way out is through being with that person, chasing that feeling over and over again.<i>”</i></i><br>
"Lose Control" has steadily grown since its release in late June, leading to Teddy Swims’ first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. <i>“When it was finished, I was showing everybody before the song came out,”</i> he says. <i>“I just felt that energy, like, ‘This is lighting in a bottle.’ I knew this was going to change my life.”</i><br>
