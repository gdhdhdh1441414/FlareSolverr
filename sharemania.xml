					Soooo I've been watching Victorious for the first time lately (yes, i've never watched it fully... SORRY) and I love Nick shows (please don't kill me, i know what used to happen on the set) and I was wondering: what would these ending taglines be if they were on iCarly?<br>
<br>
So that's the point of this thread. If you find it cool, answer this with a quote from any episode of iCarly (and the name of the episode) cuz maybe I'm fan editing them...<br>
<br>
and if you don't care just go to another post ;)<br>
<br>
bye bye thanks
