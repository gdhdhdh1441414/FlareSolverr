I ripped this from the UK promo vinyl over a year ago and intended to post it last year during The Roof's 25th anniversary. However, I was very unsure about posting it as I thought my turntable was playing the record badly, making Mariah and Kelly's vocals sound muffled and slightly distorted. It turns out the vocals really were mixed like that on the final master of the remix.<br>
<br>
I exported it in both 16-bit and 32-bit WAV along with copies in m4a and mp3 complete with metadata for quick adding to your libraries. Enjoy!<br>
