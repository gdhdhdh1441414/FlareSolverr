"<b>A Thousand Miles</b>" (originally titled "<b>Interlude</b>") is the debut single of American pop singer Vanessa Carlton. Produced by Curtis Schweitzer and Ron Fair, the song was released as the lead single for Carlton's first album, <i>Be Not Nobody</i> (2002). First released to US radio in February 2002, it became Carlton's biggest hit in the United States and her only single to reach the top 10 of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, peaking at number five. The song also experienced commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, number three in Ireland, and the top 10 in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.<br>
<br>
"A Thousand Miles" is a piano-driven pop song supported by a string orchestral arrangement. Carlton says that the song was inspired by a crush she had on a Juilliard student (who is now a "very famous actor") whom she met while she was attending the School of American Ballet. She further stated that because she never actually spoke to her crush due to her shyness, she felt like she had "a better chance of falling up than ever having a relationship with this person".<br>
She has also called the song "a combination of reality and fantasy. It's about a love that so consumes you that you do anything for it. That's how I felt at that time."<br>
<br>
First appearing as a sample in the original soundtrack of the 2001 film <i>Legally Blonde</i>, the song is Carlton's most successful single, and her only top twenty hit in the U.S.; her next highest peaking single, "Ordinary Day", went no higher than number thirty on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Carlton told VH1 in 2004, "I just sit down and write my songs ... It just kind of happened and it will never happen again like that."<br>
"A Thousand Miles" has been covered by numerous artists, including Christian Lee Hutson, Icarus the Owl, Victoria Justice, David Archuleta, Ronan Parke, the <i>Glee</i> cast, and Terry Crews.<br>
<br>
In the film <i>White Chicks</i> (2004) a group of girls refer to the song as their "jam" when it's played on the radio. It's played again two more times in the film: when Terry Crews' character sings this song to Marlon Wayans' character, and when Terry Crews' character sings it to the Wilson twins. Terry Crews' character in the film sings along with it and shakes his head hard when he hears the orchestrated hook. The song is also prominently featured in the Season 3 finale titled "Flashback in the Day" of the television sitcom <i>Workaholics</i>.<br>
<br>
Directed by Marc Klasfeld, the music video was filmed in Newbury Park, California, and in portions of Downtown Los Angeles. There was no use of green screen or visual effects, only a custom built dolly for the piano and a safety belt on Carlton. It begins with Carlton entering her garage and uncovering her piano. When she starts playing and the song begins, the piano starts to move through the neighborhood outside. While playing, she passes by bikers and footracers on the road, near a parade downtown, along the beach, and across other parts of the city, gradually taking place until the sun sets. In the end, she and the piano finally return to her garage, where she gets up and reenters the house.<br>
<br>
"A Thousand Miles" won in the Can't Get You Out of My Head category at the VH1 Big in 2002 Awards, and it was nominated for three Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s). It lost Song of the Year and Record of the Year to Norah Jones' "Don't Know Why", while the Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) award went to "Mean Old Man", performed by James Taylor. The song became popular amongst U.S. troops serving in Iraq, and in April 2003 the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> reported that it had become the most requested song on the radio station British Forces Broadcasting Service Middle East. Carlton responded, "Perhaps, 'A Thousand Miles' conveys the feelings and longing and desperation that the U.S. soldiers feel for their loved ones. I don't know. But whatever peace I am able to bring to the hearts of the people at war is a contribution that I am proud of". By May 2003 the website Musicnotes had sold a record 10,000 pieces of digital sheet music for "A Thousand Miles", and it won the website's "Song of the Year" award. The song's production team was nominated for a 2003 Technical Excellence &amp; Creativity Award in the category of Outstanding Creative Achievement in Record Production — Single or Track.<br>
