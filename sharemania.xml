True Immersive or Trumersive is another immersive audio technology that im working on, it's more funny and enjoyable than Dolby Atmos ;D<br>
<br>
This songs are 5.1, they were made to be listened with headphones but you can use a 5.1 audio system. If you listen this with headphones you may need to activate Dolby Atmos on your phone or computer...<br>
There's a README text file if you want more information.<br>
<br>
There's a lossy version of this files, here's the link: <a href="https://sharemania.us/threads/lady-gaga-chromatica-true-immersive-5-1-audio-6ch-320kbps-44khz.237310/#post-5303925" class="internalLink">M4A - Lady Gaga - Chromatica (True Immersive 5.1 Audio) 6ch 320kbps 44kHz | ShareMania.US</a><br>

"<b>Tears in Heaven</b>" is a song by English guitarist, singer, and songwriter Eric Clapton and Will Jennings, written about the death of Clapton's four-year-old son, Conor. It appeared on the 1991 <i>Rush</i> film soundtrack. In January 1992, Clapton performed the song in front of an audience at Bray Studios, Berkshire, England for <i>MTV Unplugged</i>, with the recording appearing on his <i>Unplugged</i> album.<br>
<br>
The song was Clapton's best-selling single in the United States and reached number two on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, where Clapton is from, it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, and also charted in the top 10 in more than twenty nations around the world. It won three Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked "Tears in Heaven" 362nd on its list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time".<br>
<br>
On 20 March 1991, Clapton's four-year-old son Conor, whom he had with Lory Del Santo, died after falling from the 53rd-floor window of a New York City apartment belonging to a friend of Conor’s mother. After isolating himself for a period, Clapton began working again, writing music for the film <i>Rush</i> (1991). He dealt with the grief of his son's death by cowriting "Tears in Heaven" for the soundtrack with Will Jennings. Jennings said:<br>
[Clapton] said to me, "I want to write a song about my boy." Eric had the first verse of the song written, which, to me, is all the song, but he wanted me to write the rest of the verse lines and the release ("Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees..."), even though I told him that it was so personal he should write everything himself. He told me that he had admired the work I did with Steve Winwood and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject. This is a song so personal and so sad that it is unique in my experience of writing songs.<br>
<br>
In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song: "It was in the back of my head but it didn't really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be. And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film." In an interview with Daphne Barak, he said: "I almost subconsciously used music for myself as a healing agent, and lo and behold, it worked... I have got a great deal of happiness and a great deal of healing from music."<br>
<br>
Shortly after the single was released, Clapton recorded the song in front of an audience at Bray Studios, Berkshire, England as part of a set for the MTV Unplugged television series. The album, released as <i>Unplugged, </i>topped numerous charts, including the US, Japan and Australia, reached number two in the UK. It was nominated for nine Grammy Awards and won three of them at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993. It became Clapton's bestselling album, and the bestselling live album of all time, selling 26 million copies worldwide.<br>
