<blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">
This series is on amazon, itunes and Starz, all of which I don't have. I have only been able to find clips so don't know how long the episodes are but there is only eight episodes and one series.<br>
<br>
As for quality, I would be very grateful if it was 1080p, but I just want to watch the series, so any quality would be fine.
