I don't have a source, but I feel strongly that Shania Twain once said in an interview many years ago that all the shows from the Come on Over and Up! tours were professionally recorded. It's hard to say for the former, but the Up! Tour definitely had multiple cameras as some <a href="https://youtu.be/xnisb8lY1dc?feature=shared&amp;t=4245" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">fan footage</a> exists of the video feed playing on a screen at the top of the arena. There's also videos (<a href="https://youtu.be/UkVdWqqdBAg?feature=shared" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/WXByaTZ6kxg?feature=shared" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">this</a>) a musician posted on YouTube including various clips of him playing guitar on that tour, again with multi cam. <br>
<br>
Of course now it is the standard for any major artist playing a big venue for there to be a huge screen so the people with cheap seats can still see the artist. <br>
<br>
My question is...where is all this footage? I have seen "Shania Twain Archives" referenced at least once in official media and I'm sure tons of artists have something similar with all kinds of concerts, shows, and performances that no one has ever seen. <br>
<br>
Is all this footage sitting in cloud storage / hard drives that only the record labels have access to? Do you think someday a streaming service will be invented for this kind of thing?<br>
<br>
I'm sure stans of Beyonce, Swift, and many others have wondered this same thing and would do just about anything to get their hands on the full official media collection of their fave. <br>
