"<b>Invisible</b>" is a song by Irish rock band U2. Produced by Danger Mouse, it was released as a non-album single on 2 February 2014. The song was unveiled in a Super Bowl XLVIII television advertisement, launching a promotion that offered the song as a free digital download in the iTunes Store from 2–3 February. For each download of the track, Bank of America donated $1 to (RED), an organization co-founded by lead vocalist Bono, to fight HIV/AIDS. Ultimately, $3.1 million was raised during the 36-hour promotion. Since 4 February, "Invisible" has been available as a paid download that continues to benefit (RED).<br>
<br>
Written and recorded during the sessions for the band's 14th album <i>Songs of Innocence</i>, "Invisible" was the second non-album single to be issued leading up to the album's September 2014 release, following "Ordinary Love" in 2013. A longer version of "Invisible" was later included as a hidden track on certain deluxe editions of <i>Songs of Innocence</i>. Lyrically, "Invisible" was inspired by the group's early experiences of leaving home to play in London with the desire to be noticed by audiences, as well as Bono's tumultuous relationship with his father.<br>
<br>
<i>'The early lyrics were set on a train coming into London for the first time. I remember sleeping in Euston station, being broke... coming out of the subway into the spring of 1979, being 18 years old, it was punk rock in London.'</i><br>
<br>
The song, described as an electronic-tinged rock anthem, was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. The song has also charted in several countries, and topped the <i>Billboard</i> Adult Alternative Songs chart in the United States. A music video for the song was directed by Mark Romanek and released on 11 February 2014. U2 performed the song on the premiere episode of <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> on the observation deck of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.<br>
<br>
The music video for "Invisible" was directed by Mark Romanek, and shot in black-and-white in a Santa Monica airport hangar in January 2014. With a cast of 1200. And flashlights. It shows the band performing the song in front of a captive audience, against a massive screen with multiple video effects, with Bono singing to a circular hangdown microphone.<br>
A sixty second clip premiered on February 2nd during the Super Bowl, to launch the partnership with (RED). The full-length video premiered on 11 February 2014.<br>
