Lyrics : ... / I was s'posed to be sent away / But they forgot to come and get me / I was a functioning alcoholic / 'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic / All of this to say, I hope you're okay / But you're the reason / And no one here's to blame / But what about your quiet treason? / And for a fortnight there we were forever running / 'Til you sometimes ask about the weather / Now you're in my backyard turned into good neighbors / Your wife waters flowers, I want to kill her / All my mornings are Monday stuck in an endless February / I took the miracle move on drug, the effects were temporary / And I love you, it's ruining my life / I love you, it's ruining my life / I touched you for only a fortnight / I touched you, but I touched you / And for a fortnight there we were forever running / 'Til you sometimes ask about the weather / Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors / Your wife waters flowers, I want to kill her / And for a fortnight there we were together running / 'Til you sometimes come and tug my sweater / Now you're at the mailbox turned into good neighbors / My husband is cheating, I want to kill him / I love you, it's ruining my life / I love you, it's ruining my life / I touched you for only a fortnight / I touched you, I touched you / I love you, it's ruining my life / I love you, it's ruining my life / I touched you for only a fortnight / I touched you, I touched you / I call you up but you won't pick up / Another fortnight lost in America / Move to Florida, buy the car you want (Car you want) / But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me / I call you up but you won't pick up / Another fortnight lost in America / Move to Florida, buy the car you want / But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you<br>

Lyrics : ... / You left your typewriter at my apartment / Straight from the tortured poets department / I think some things I never say, like / "Who uses typewriters anyway?" / But you're in self-sabotage mode / Throwing spikes down on the road / But I've seen this episode and still love the show / Who else decodes you? / And who's gonna hold you? / Like me / And who's gonna know you? / If not me / I laughed in your face and said / You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith / This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots / And who's gonna hold you? / Like me / No, nobody / No-fucking-body / Nobody / You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate / We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist / I scratch your head, you fall asleep / Like a tattooed golden retriever / But you awaken with dread / Pounding nails in your head / But I've read this one where you come undone / I chose this cyclone with you / And who's gonna hold you? / Like me (Who's gonna hold you, who's gonna hold you?) / And who's gonna know you? / Like me (Who's gonna hold you?) / I laughed in your face and said / You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith / This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots / And who's gonna hold you? / Like me (Who's gonna hold you, who's gonna hold you?) / No-fucking-body (Who's gonna hold you, who's gonna hold you?) / Nobody (Who's gonna hold you, gonna hold you?) / Nobody / Sometimes I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me / But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave / And I had said that to Jack about you so I felt seen / Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be / Because we're crazy / So tell me who else is gonna love me / At dinner you take my ring off my middle finger / And put it on the one people put wedding rings on / And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding / Who's gonna hold you? Me / Who's gonna know you? Me / And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith / This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots / Who's gonna hold you? / Who's gonna hold you? / Who's gonna hold you? / Who's gonna hold you? / Who's gonna hold you? / Who's gonna hold you? / Who's gonna hold you? / Who's gonna hold you? / Gonna know you? / You left your typewriter at my apartment / Straight from the tortured poets department / Who else decodes you?<br>

Lyrics : ... / Did you really beam me up? / In a cloud of sparkling dust / Just to do experiments on / Tell me I was the chosen one / Showed me that this world is bigger than us / Then sent me back where I came from / For a moment I knew cosmic love / Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym / Everything comes out teenage petulance / "Fuck it if I can't have him" / "I might just die, it would make no difference" / Down bad, waking up in blood / Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up / Fuck it if I can't have us / I might just not get up / I might stay down bad / Fuck it if I can't have him / Down bad / Fuck it if I can't have him / Did you take all my old clothes? / Just to leave me here naked and alone / In a field in my same old town / That somehow seems so hollow now / They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about / The existence of you / For a moment, I was heavenstruck / Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym / Everything comes out teenage petulance / "Fuck it if I can't have him" / "I might just die, it would make no difference" / Down bad, waking up in blood / Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up / Fuck it if I can't have us / I might just not get up / I might stay down bad (Like I lost my twin) / Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad) / Down bad (Waving at the ship) / Fuck it if I can't have him / I loved your hostile take-overs / Encounters closer and closer / All your indecent exposures / How dare you say that it's– / I'll build you a fort on some planet / Where they can all understand it / How dare you think it's romantic / Leaving me safe and stranded? / 'Cause fuck it, I was in love / So fuck you if I can't have us / 'Cause fuck it, I was in love / Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym / Everything comes out teenage petulance / "Fuck it if I can't have him" / "I might just die, it would make no difference" / Down bad, waking up in blood / Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up / Fuck it if I can't have us / I might just not get up / I might stay down bad (Like I lost my twin) / Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad) / Down bad (Waving at the ship) / Fuck it if I can't have him / Like I lost my twin / Fuck it if I can't have him / Down bad (Waving at the ship) / Fuck it if I can't have him<br>

Lyrics : ... / I saw in my mind ferry lights through the mist / I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift / Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away / My spine split from carrying us up the hill / Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill / I stopped trying to make him laugh, stopped trying to drill the safe / Thinking how much sad did you think I had, did you think I had in me? / Oh the tragedy / So long London / You'll find someone / I didn't opt in to be your odd man out / I founded the club she's heard great things about / I left all I knew you left me at the house by the Heath / I stopped CPR, after all it's no use / The spirit was gone, we would never come to / And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free / For so long, London / Stitches undone / Two graves, one gun / I'll find someone / And you say I abandoned the ship, but I was going down with it / My white knuckle dying grip holding tight to your quiet resentment / And my friends said it isn't right to be scared / Every day old love affair, Every breath feels like rarest air / When you're not sure if he wants to be there / So how much sad did you think I had, did you think I had in me? / How much tragedy? / Just how low did you think I'd go 'fore I'd self implode? / 'Fore I'd have to go be free? / You swore that you loved, me but where were the clues? / I died on the altar waiting for the proof / You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days / And I'm just getting color back into my face / I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for / So long, London / Had a good run / A moment of warm sun / But I'm not the one / So long, London / Stitches undone / Two graves, one gun / You'll find someone<br>

Lyrics : ... / I forget how the west was won / I forget if this was ever fun / I just learned these people only raise you / To cage you / Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best / Clutchin' their pearls sighing, "What a mess" / I just learned these people try and save you / 'Cause they hate you / Too high a horse for a simple girl / To rise above it / They slammed the door on my whole world / The one thing I wanted / Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned / Screamin', "But, daddy, I love him" / I'm having his baby / No, I'm not, but you should see your faces / I'm telling him to floor it through the fences / No, I'm not coming to my senses / I know it's crazy / But he's the one I want / Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid / Tendrils tucked into a woven braid / Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all / He was chaos, he was revelry / Bedroom eyes like a remedy / Soon enough the elders had convened down at the city hall / "Stay away from her," the saboteurs / Protested too much / Lord knows the words we never heard / Just screeching tires of true love / And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned / Screaming, "But daddy I love him" / I'm having his baby / No, I'm not, but you should see your faces / I'm telling him to floor it through the fences / No, I'm not coming to my senses / I know it's crazy / But he's the one I want / I'll tell you something right now / I'd rather burn my whole life down / Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin' / I'll tell you something 'bout my good name / It's mine alone to disgrace / I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing / God save the most judgmental creeps / Who say they want what's best for me / Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see / Thinking it can change the beat of my heart when he touches me / And counteract the chemistry / And undo the destiny / You ain't gotta pray for me / Me and my wild boy, and all of this wild joy / If all you want is gray for me / Then it's just white noise, then it's just my choice / There's a lot of people in town that I bestow upon my fakest smiles / Scandal does funny things to pride but brings lovers closer / We came back when the heat died down / Went to my parents and they came around / All the wine moms are still holding out / But fuck 'em, it's over / Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun and / Even my daddy just loves him / I'm his lady / And oh my God, you should see your faces / Time, doesn't it give some perspective / And no, you can't come to the wedding / I know it's crazy, but he's the one I love / I'll tell you something right now / You ain't gotta pray for me / Me and my wild boy, and all of this wild joy (It was chaos, it was revelry) / It's all you want is gray for me / Then it's just white noise, it's my choice / Screamin', "But, daddy, I love him" / I'm having his baby / No, I'm not / But you should see your faces / And oh my God, you should see your faces / It was chaos, it was revelry / It was chaos, it was revelry<br>

Lyrics : ... / Now, pretty baby / I'm runnin' back home to you / Fresh out the slammer / I know who my first call will be to / (Fresh out the slammer, oh) / Another summer, taking cover, rolling thunder / He don't understand me / Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter / He was with her in dreams / Gray and blue and fights and tunnels / Handcuffed to the spell I was under / For just one hour of sunshine / Years of labor, locks and ceilings / In the shade of how he was feeling / But it's gonna be alright, I did my time / Now, pretty baby / I'm runnin' back home to you / Fresh out the slammer / I know who my first call will be to / (Fresh out the slammer, oh) / Camera flashes, welcome bashes / Get the matches, toss the ashes off the ledge / As I said in my letters, now that I know better / I will never lose my baby again / My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it / Watched me daily disappearing / For just one glimpse of his smile / All those nights you kept me goin' / Swirled you into all of my poems / Now we're at the starting line / I did my time / Now, pretty baby / I'm runnin' / To the house where you still wait up / And that porch light gleams (Gleams) / To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams / And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway / Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up / Now that I know what's at stake here / At the park where we used to sit on children's swings / Wearing imaginary rings / But it's gonna be alright, I did my time<br>

Lyrics : You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too / They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true / And my friends, all smell like weed or little babies / And the city reeks of driving myself crazy / Little did you know your home's really only / A town you're just a guest in / So you work your life away just to pay / For a time-share down in Destin / Florida / Is one hell of a drug / Florida / Can I use you up? / The hurricane with my name when it came / I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away / Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine / Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time / Yes, I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine / All my girls got their lace and their crimes / And your cheating husband disappeared / Well, no one asks any questions here / So I did my best to lay to rest / All of the bodies that have ever been on my body / And in my mind, they sink into the swamp / Is that a bad thing to say in a song? / Little did you know your home's really only / The town you'll get arrested / So you pack your life away just to wait out / The shitstorm back in Texas / Florida / Is one hell of a drug / Florida / Can I use you up? / I need to forget, so take me to Florida / I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida / Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable / At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida / I need to forget, so take me to Florida / I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida / Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable / What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida / Is one hell of a drug / Is one hell of a drug / Love left me like this and I don't want to exist / So take me to Florida / Little did you know your home's really only / A town you're just a guest in (Florida) / So you work your life away just to pay / For a time-share down in Destin (Take me to Florida) / Little did you know your home's really only / The town you'll get arrested (Florida) / So you pack your life away just to wait out / The shitstorm back in Texas / Florida / Is one hell of a drug / (Take me to) Florida / Can I use you up? / Florida / Is one hell of a drug / Florida / Go on, fuck me up<br>

Lyrics : ... / Drowning in the Blue Nile / He sent me "Downtown Lights" / I hadn't heard it in a while / My boredom's bone deep / This cage was once just fine / Am I allowed to cry? / I dream of cracking locks / Throwing my life to the wolves / Or the ocean rocks / Crashing into him tonight / He's a paradox / I'm seeing visions / Am I bad, or mad, or wise? / What if he's written "Mine" on my upper thigh / Only in my mind? / One slip and falling back into the hedge maze / Oh, what a way to die / I keep recalling things we never did / Messy top lip kiss / How I long for our trysts / Without ever touching his skin / How can I be guilty as sin? / I keep these longings locked / In lowercase inside a vault / Someone told me / There's no such thing as bad thoughts / Only your actions talk / These fatal fantasies / Giving way to labored breath / Taking all of me / We've already done it in my head / If it's make believe / Why does it feel like a vow / We'll both uphold somehow? / What if he's written "Mine" on my upper thigh / Only in my mind? / One slip and falling back into the hedge maze / Oh, what a way to die / My bedsheets are a blaze / I've screamed his name / Building up like waves / Crashing over my grave / Without ever touching his skin / How can I be guilty as sin? / What if I roll the stone away? / They're gonna crucify me anyway / What if the way you hold me / Is actually what's holy? / If long suffering propriety / Is what they want from me / They don't know how you've haunted me / So stunningly / I choose you and me / Religiously / What if he's written "Mine" on my upper thigh / Only in my mind / One slip and falling back into the hedge maze / Oh, what a way to die / I keep recalling things we never did / Messy top lip kiss / How I long for our trysts / Without ever touching his skin / How can I be guilty as sin? / He sent me "Downtown Lights" / I hadn't heard it in a while / Am I allowed to cry?<br>

Lyrics : ... / The who's who of who's that is poised for the attack / But my bare hands paved their paths / You don't get to tell me about sad / If you wanted me dead you should've just said / Nothing makes me feel more alive / So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street / Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream / "Who's afraid of little old me?" / You should be / ... / Her scandal was contained / The bullet had just grazed / At all costs keep your good name / You don't get to tell me you feel bad / Is it a wonder I broke? / Let's hear one more joke / Then we could all just laugh until I cry / So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street / Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream / "Who's afraid of little old me?" / I was tame, I was gentle till the circus life made me mean / Don't you worry folks, we took out all her teeth / Who's afraid of little old me? / Well you should be / (You should be), you should be / (You should be), you should be / You should be / (You should be), you should be / (You should be), you should be / So tell me everything is not about me, but what if it is? / Then say they didn't do it to hurt me, but what if they did? / I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me / You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me / So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs / I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said? / That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn / That I'm fearsome, and I'm wretched and I'm wrong / Put narcotics into all of my songs / And that's why you're still singing along / So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street / Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream / "Who's afraid of little old me?" / I was tame, I was gentle till the circus life made me mean / Don't you worry folks we took out all her teeth / Who's afraid of little old me? / Well you should be / (You should be), you should be / (You should be), you should be / 'Cause you lured me (you should be) and you hurt me (you should be) / And you taught me / You caged me and then you called me crazy / I am what I am 'cause you trained me / So who's afraid of me? / Who's afraid of little old me? / Who's afraid of little old me?<br>

Lyrics : ... / The smoke cloud billows out his mouth / Like a freight train through a small town / The jokes that he told across the bar / Were revolting and far too loud / They shake their heads saying, "God, help her" / When I tell 'em he's my man / But your good lord doesn't need to lift a finger / I can fix him, no, really, I can / And only I can / The dopamine races through his brain on a six-lane Texas highway / His hands so callus from his pistol softly traces hearts on my face / And I could see it from a mile away / A perfect case for my certain skill set / He had a halo of the highest grade / He just hadn't met me yet / They shake their heads saying, "God, help her" / When I tell 'em he's my man / But your good lord doesn't need to lift a finger / I can fix him, no, really, I can / And only I can / Good boy, that's right / Come close / I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all mine / Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man / No really, I can / They shook their heads saying, "God, help her" / When I told them he's my man (I told them he's my man) / But your good lord didn't need to lift a finger / I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can) / Woah, maybe I can't<br>

Lyrics : ... / Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames / If we know the steps anyway / We embroidered the memories of the times I was away / Stitching, "We were just kids, babe" / I said, "I don't mind, it takes time" / I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed / I felt a glow like this, never before and never since / If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary / You and I go from one kiss to getting married / Still alive, killing time at the cemetery / Never quite buried / And your suit and tie, in the nick of time / You low-down boy, you stand-up guy / Holy ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life / You said I'm the love of your life / About a million times / Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate / And told me I reformed you / When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes / Well, you took me to hell too / And all at once, the ink bleeds / A con man sells a fool a "get love quick" scheme / I felt a hole like this, never before and ever since / If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary / What we thought was for all time was momentary / Still alive, killing time at the cemetery / Never quite buried / You sent a file in black and white / All those plot twists and dynamite / Mr. Steal-Your-Girl, then make her cry / Said I'm the love of your life / You shit-talked me under the table / Talking rings and talking cradles / I wish I could unrecall / How we almost had it all / Dancing phantoms on the terrace / Are they second-hand embarrassed / That I can't get out of bed / 'Cause something counterfeit's dead / It was legendary / It was momentary / It was unnecessary / Should've let it stay buried / Oh, what a valiant roar / What a bland goodbye / The coward claimed he was a lion / I'm combing through the braids of lies / I'll never leave, never mind / Our field of dreams engulfed in fire / Your arson's match, your somber eyes / And I'll still see until I die / You're the loss of my life<br>

Lyrics : Was any of it true? / Gazing at me starry-eyed / In your Jehovah's Witness suit / Who the fuck was that guy? / You tried to buy some pills / From a friend of friends of mine / They just ghosted you / Now you know what it feels like / And I don't even want you back, I just want to know / If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal / And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give / A message to the smallest man who ever lived? / You hung me on your wall / Stabbed me with your push pins / In public, showed me off / Then sank in stoned oblivion / 'Cause once your queen had come / You'd treat her like an also-ran / You didn't measure up / In any measure of a man / And I don't even want you back, I just want to know / If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal / And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give / A message to the smallest man who ever lived? / Were you sent by someone / Who wanted me dead? / Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed? / Were you writing a book? / Were you a sleeper cell spy? / In fifty years will all this be declassified? / And you'll confess why you did it / And I'll say, "Good riddance" / 'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden / I would've died for your sins / Instead I just died inside / And you deserve prison, but you won't get time / You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars / You crashed my party and your rental car / You said normal girls were "boring" / But you were gone by the morning / You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing / And in plain sight you hid / But you are what you did / And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive / The smallest man who ever lived<br>

Lyrics : This happens once every few lifetimes / These chemicals hit me like white wine / What if I told you I'm back? / The hospital was a drag / Worst sleep that I ever had / I circled you on a map / I haven't come around in so long / But I'm coming back so strong / So when I touch down / Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team / Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I'm the one to be / 'Cause the sign on your heart / Said it's still reserved for me / Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy? / Hey, you, what if I told you we're cool? / That child's play back in school / Is forgiven under my rule / I haven't come around in so long / But I'm making a comeback to where I belong / So when I touch down / Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team / Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I'm the one to be / 'Cause the sign on your heart / Said it's still reserved for me / Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy? / These blokes warm the benches / We've been on a winning streak / He jokes that "It's heroin, but this time with an E" / 'Cause the sign on your heart / Said it's still reserved for me / Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy? / Shirts off, and your friends lift you up, over their heads / Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said / "There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league" / Where's the trophy? He just comes, running over to me / Touch down / Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team / Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I'm the one to be / 'Cause the sign on your heart / Said it's still reserved for me / Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy? / These blokes warm the benches / We've been on a winning streak / He jokes that "It's heroin, but this time with an E" / 'Cause the sign on your heart / Said it's still reserved for me / Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy? / This happens once every few lifetimes / These chemicals hit me like white wine<br>

Lyrics : ... / You look like Clara Bow / In this light, remarkable / All your life, did you know / You'd be picked like a rose? / I'm not trying to exaggerate / But I think I might die if it happened / Die if it happened to me / No one in my small town thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan / This town is fake but you're the real thing / Breath of fresh air through smoke rings / Take the glory, give everything / Promise to be dazzling / You look like Stevie Nicks in '75 / The hair and lips / The crowd goes wild at her fingertips / Half moonshine, a full eclipse / I'm not trying to exaggerate / But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it / No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in LA / They all want to say / This town is fake but you're the real thing / Breath of fresh air through smoke rings / Take the glory, give everything / Promise to be dazzling / The crown is stained, but you're the real queen / Flesh and blood amongst war machines / You're the new god we're worshipping / Promise to be dazzling / Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours demanding more / Only when your girlish glow flickers just so / Do they let you know? / It's hell on earth to be heavenly / Them's the brakes, they don't come gently / You look like Taylor Swift / In this light, we're loving it / You've got edge, she never did / The future's bright, dazzling<br>
