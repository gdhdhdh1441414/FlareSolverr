<br>
"<b>Porcelain</b>" is a song by American electronic musician Moby. It was released on April 25, 2000, as the sixth single from his fifth studio album <i>Play</i> (1999). The song is written by Moby, who also performs vocals on the recording, backed by a sample of vocalist Pilar Basso. Moby told <i>Billboard</i> magazine in 2000 that "Porcelain" was inspired by an ill-fated romance. <i>"I was involved with this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much," he explained. "But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being in love with someone but knowing you shouldn't be with them."</i><br>
It features a lush musical backing that incorporates reversed strings and various synthesized elements. While Moby initially expressed disdain over the song and its production, he was eventually talked into including it on <i>Play</i>.<br>
<br>
It was one of the most successful singles from <i>Play</i>. "Porcelain" became a top five hit in the United Kingdom and entered various other national record charts. Contributing to the song's commercial exposure was its use in several forms of media, including a notable placement in the 2000 film <i>The Beach</i>. Music critics have highlighted "Porcelain" as a standout track on <i>Play</i>, and it has also been included on several year-end and all-time lists of the best songs.<br>
<br>
Two separate music videos were produced for "Porcelain". The first version, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, is primarily a simple closeup of a human eye; various images are reflected onto the eye throughout the entire video, including Moby performing the song, people smiling, and a piano being played. This version only aired in European markets and was not released in the US until its inclusion on the 2001 video album <i>Play: The DVD</i>.<br>
<br>
The second video (this one), directed by Nick Brandt, follows a driverless 1972 Cadillac DeVille, in which Moby is a passenger, as it travels through a city and a countryside, passing various people in slow motion. The car drives through a field, a forest, past cattle, and finally down a hillside going into the distance.<br>
