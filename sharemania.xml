</div><b>Lyrics:</b><br>
<br>
<i>They call me offensive, controversial<br>
There's only two genders, boys and girls<br>
They can't cancel my message 'cause I'm the biggest independent rapper in the whole freaking world<br>
Claim that I'm racist, yeah, alright<br>
I'm not ashamed because I'm white<br>
If every Caucasian's a bigot, I guess every Muslim's a terrorist, every liberal is right<br>
I don't wanna talk to folks who don't get it (Tss)<br>
Go woke, go broke, no hope, it's pathetic<br>
Pro-choice, pronouns, pro-love, you're progressives<br>
But you ain't pro-gun, no one to protect it<br>
Where the American flags at?<br>
Remember when people would hang those?<br>
They've been taken down, they all been replaced with BLM flags or a rainbow<br>
<br>
This ain't rap, this ain't money, cars, and clothes<br>
We ain't sellin' drugs, we ain't gonna overdose<br>
We ain't pushing guns, ain't promoting stripper poles<br>
We won't turn your sons into thugs or your daughters into hoes<br>
<br>
I don't care if I offend you<br>
I was put here to upset you<br>
You can cry and you can scream, you can riot in the streets<br>
You defunded the police, now there's no one to protect you<br>
I hope I offend you<br>
I ask myself, "What would Ben do?"<br>
Let's just keep it real, facts don't care how you feel, man<br>
If you want my pronouns, I'm the man, I'm the man who don't respect you<br>
<br>
Let's look at the stats, I've got the facts<br>
My money like Lizzo, my pockets are fat<br>
Homie, I'm epic, don't be a WAP<br>
Dawg, it's a yarmulke, homie, no cap<br>
Look at the graphs, look at my charts<br>
You're blowing money on strippers and cars<br>
You're going to prison, I'm on television<br>
Dawgs, no one knows who you are<br>
Keep hating on me on the internet<br>
My comments section all woke Karens<br>
And I make racks off compound interest<br>
Y'all live with your parents<br>
Nicki, take some notes, I just did this for fun<br>
All my people download this, let's get a Billboard number one<br>
<br>
This ain't rap, this ain't money, cars, and clothes<br>
We ain't sellin' drugs, we ain't gonna overdose<br>
We ain't pushing guns and promoting stripper poles<br>
We won't turn your sons into thugs or your daughters into hoes<br>
<br>
I don't care if I offend you<br>
I was put here to upset you<br>
You can cry and you can scream, you can riot in the streets<br>
You defunded the police, now there's no one to protect you<br>
I hope I offend you<br>
I ask myself, "What would Ben do?"<br>
Let's just keep it real, facts don't care how you feel, man<br>
If you want my pronouns, I'm the man, I'm the man who don't respect you<br>
<br>
You mad, you mad, you mad<br>
I guess it's cool to be the victim, well, I'ma be the man<br>
You sad, you sad, you sad<br>
You just try to get attention, being triggered's all you have<br>
You mad, you mad, you mad<br>
You blame everybody else for every problem that you can<br>
You sad, you sad, you sad<br>
I will never say I'm sorry, I ain't taking nothing back<br>
<br>
I don't care if I offend you<br>
I was put here to upset you<br>
You can cry and you can scream, you can riot in the streets<br>
You defunded the police, now there's no one to protect you<br>
I hope I offend you<br>
I ask myself, "What would Ben do?"<br>
Let's just keep it real, facts don't care how you feel, man<br>
If you want my pronouns, I'm the man, I'm the man who don't respect you</i><br>
