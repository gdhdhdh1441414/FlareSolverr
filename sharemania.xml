"<b>Think I’m In Love With You</b>" is a song by American musician Chris Stapleton. It was released through Mercury Nashville on November 10, 2023, as the sixth track from his fifth studio album, Higher (2023). Stapleton penned "Think I'm In Love With You"' himself and co-produced it with his wife, Morgane Stapleton, and his longtime producer, Dave Cobb.<br>
<br>
Chris Stapleton and Dua Lipa made for one of the biggest surprises of the evening at the 2024 Academy of Country Music Awards, when they paired up to perform a collaborative version of the song. On May 20, they officially released the performance, titled “Think I’m In Love With You (with Dua Lipa) (Live From the 59th ACM Awards),” on all streaming platforms.<br>
<br>
Dua Lipa said that <i>“just being a massive fan of his”</i> led to her reaching out to Stapleton about collaborating. “He’s a master of his craft, and I’ve just been a fan of his for so long, and I’ve had the opportunity to just sit down and brainstorm ideas on how we can reimagine the song, and bring something really special and unique…it’s one of those moments in my life where I’m so happy to be a musician and be creating something and doing something that feels so exciting.”<br>
<br>
Stapleton added that conversations regarding a collaboration had been in the works for a while, but they got together to rehearse the performance only a few days before the awards show.<br>
<i>“I think she threw herself into the mix,”</i> Stapleton told the outlet<i>. “We got on the phone and talked about it and worked on it a little bit. We really only kind of put together what we did like two days ago… It was kind of a whirlwind of a thing to do — but it was awesome.”</i><br>
<br>
Stapleton’s Higher project won album of the year during the ACM Awards, marking his fourth win in the category.<br>

Hello!<br>
<br>
Does anyone have the Daddy Cool Musical London Recording based on Boney M? <br>
<br>
I can't find it anywhere and there's only a Dutch version on YouTube.<br>
<br>
Thanks!
