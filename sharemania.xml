"<b>Lunch</b>" is a song by American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish and the lead single from her third studio album, <i>Hit Me Hard and Soft</i> (2024). It was released on May 17, 2024. The song features a heavy bassline and lyrics that detail Eilish's same-gender sexual attraction, following her public confirmation that she liked both men and women. In the lyrics, which she wrote after realizing that she wanted to try cunnilingus, she describes that desire (and her general sexual appetite), saying she "could eat that girl for lunch".<br>
<br>
Speculation around Eilish's sexual orientation began when she released the music video for the single "Lost Cause" in 2021. The video features Eilish in a slumber party with several women, doing various activities such as twerking, playing Twister, and spraying silly string. Many fans and media outlets saw the video as homoerotic, while others accused her of queerbaiting. In response, Eilish posted behind-the-scenes pictures from the video on Instagram with the caption "I love girls".<br>
<br>
In November 2023, Eilish appeared for a <i>Variety</i> cover story, in which she discussed her relationship to sexuality and womanhood, as well as her frustration with people speculating on her sexual orientation. She said that she had always felt an emotional attraction to women alongside physical attraction, admitting that she can be overawed with women she found beautiful. A month later, during a red carpet for the magazine's "Hitmakers" event, a reporter asked Eilish if her comments during her interview were meant as a coming out statement, to which she said that it was not the intention and that she thought her sexual orientation was already obvious. When the event concluded, she took to Instagram to criticize the reporter for their question, accusing them of outing her and confirming she liked both men and women.<br>
<br>
In the music video for "Lunch," self-directed by Billie Eilish, she embraces a return to her earlier style. Clad in baggy streetwear, Eilish dances with clones of herself against a backdrop of vibrant, saturated colors. It premiered via her Vevo channel on YouTube twelve hours after the song's and album's release.<br>
