Rap, trap, hiphop​</div><br>
The producer of the song exported the song as lossy, most likely MP3. Because of this, my otherwise direct Deezer rip appears lossy. I'm also including my YouTube Music rip, because it seems like it's a /little/ better, while also appearing lossy. I've also compared it to the "Don't turn victim" releases and they are lossier. I'm including both so you can choose whatever track you want.<br>
<br>
TL;DR: This includes the Deezer rip [<b>44.1kHz/16-bit FLAC</b>], and YouTube Music [<b>48kHz/16-bit FLAC</b>]. YouTube Music rip is arguably better with frequency integrity. Choose whatever.<br>

</div>Also, the music video for this song ended up being taken down from YouTube and is now part of an investigation by police because the song quite literally gives almost an exact rundown on how to commit fraudulent wire transferring. So far, $160k was seized from him. I've managed to snag an MKV rip of the music video, but it has translated Spanish lyrics across the video. Anyone else got a copy of the original? Just for data scraping purposes. ;-)
