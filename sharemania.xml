Plot:</b> For over 5000 years, Black Adam has been imprisoned, having been gifted with the powerful abilities of the Egyptian gods. His power was so immense and overwhelming that the gods deemed him too dangerous for the mortals to wield, and so he was locked away in a secret prison, hidden in the depths of the Earth. For centuries, Black Adam remained locked up, forgotten by the gods and all but a few mortals who knew of his existence. But, when an ancient prophecy foretold the return of the gods, Black Adam's prison was opened and he was set free. Now, Black Adam is determined to use his newfound freedom to exact revenge on those who have wronged him and to reclaim his rightful place as the king of the gods. He is a force to be reckoned with, and his powerful abilities make him a formidable foe. Those who face him must be prepared for a battle unlike any other they have ever experienced.<br>
<b>Cast:</b> Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge, Noah Centineo, Sarah Shahi, Marwan Kenzari, Quintessa Swindell, Pierce Brosnan<br>
<b>Director:</b> Jaume Collet-Serra<br>
