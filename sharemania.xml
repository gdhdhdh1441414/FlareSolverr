<br>
"When Nobody Loves You" is the main theme from the Quantum of Solace video game and it is performed by Kerli.<br>
<br>
This song was never officially released but the original file is inside this game.<br>
<br>
The music is most likely in HIGH DEFINITION, so if you can get this... please send me the music exactly as it is in the game (same format so Please do not convert)<br>
<br>
This game was released on Playstation, Xbox and more.<br>
<br>
It's a difficult task, yes. But it's the only way to get this material in HIGH QUALITY, so it's a RARE file.<br>
<br>
I already tried to extract this audio but I can't install it because I don't understand anything about games.
