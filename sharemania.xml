"<b>Ghost Love Score</b>" is a song by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and is the ninth track on their fifth studio album "Once", released on 7 June 2004. It was written by keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen and produced by Holopainen and TeeCee Kinnunen. Up to that point, at ten minutes long, it was the second longest song Nightwish had released, after "Beauty of the Beast" from the previous album Century Child. An instrumental version appeared on "Wish I Had an Angel", while an orchestral version can be found on the Japanese release of "Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan".<br>
<br>
"Ghost Love Score" was recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Holopainen recalled of the recording: <i>"We've done four albums now with orchestras and symphonic sounds, and then you have to be willing to take the next step and take ten more steps, and that's how we got to the London Philharmonic Orchestra [...] Musically it was very relaxed on our part, because everyone in the orchestra knew their part, so we basically lay on the couch for two days listening to all these people play our songs, and we enjoyed every moment. It was one of the best experiences of my life. The first song they played was "Ghost Love Score", we didn't know what to expect, and I thought: This can't be true!"</i><br>
<br>
Holopainen was inspired by progressive rock music while writing "Ghost Love Score". He said: <i>"I'm a big fan of old progressive rock and this is a song that has a lot of different parts, and different vibes in different places to support the story. That's why I like this song; there's a lot of variety and it's always interesting to play it live my biggest influence from the prog world has got to be Jethro Tull but I also like listening to Yes and Genesis and bands like that and there's a similarity between the structure and the length of many of their songs and this song."</i><br>
<br>
"Ghost Love Score" is on the latest Nightwish album that features original vocalist Tarja Turunen. Nevertheless, the song was often played live after her departure, including with their third lead vocalist, Dutch singer and songwriter Floor Jansen. It appeared on the 2013 live album Showtime, Storytime. Speaking of the challenges of performing the song live, she said, <i>"It's one of the biggest challenges to sing that because it's so hard to sing it right. But of course I felt that was the ending. ..yes I always sang it differently, and it grew into what it eventually became, which became so distinctive about me that the fans love it very much I love playing it because it has become so special and because it comes out in a way that you can't predict, you can't make things like this, they just happen, and this happened. And in that way, that makes this song very special to me."</i><br>
<br>
This music video is ripped from the <i>Showtime, Storytime </i>Blu-ray from Nightwish. Nuclear Blast recorded their live performance at Wacken Open Air in Wacken, Germany on 3 August 2013. <i>Showtime, Storytime</i> is the first Nightwish production to feature Floor Jansen on vocals. She initially replaced previous vocalist Anette Olzon during their North America tour leg, and on 9 October 2013 it was revealed that she would become an official band member, along with Troy Donockley.<br>

<b>Release Info</b><br>
I just could not skip this one. It's my favorite live performance by Nightwish.<br>
The video track is upscaled to 4K with Topaz Video AI and encoded to HEVC 10-bit.<br>
The audio tracks are lossless and are the original tracks from the Blu-ray.<br>
The timed lyrics are synced and edited to match the music video.<br>

<b>Side note</b><br>
There are loads of incorrect lyrics available. I've copied the lyrics from this release directly from the Nightwish site. Floor does not sing everything correctly, including a teet at 02:17,.. but you can't blame her. She had to learn the whole setlist in 48 hours.<br>
