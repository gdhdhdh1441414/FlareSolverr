Hi I am looking for this album in specifically the ALAC Lossless Hi-Res format. It would really greatly appreciated if someone could get this. It would really mean a lot to me as Spider-Man is someone that means so much me and my family. <br>
<br>
here is the apple music link <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-soundtrack-from/1453876765" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">https://music.apple.com/us/album/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-soundtrack-from/1453876765</a> <br>
Thank you so much in advance.
