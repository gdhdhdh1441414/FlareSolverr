In the early 2000s, MTV had a series known as “Making The Game” where they had special interviews and footage of various video games such as Tony Hawk Underground or Halo 2 etc. In 2004, they created one for the Spider-Man 2 video game. If you search on YouTube, the video can be found in multiple places however there is a Russian dub over the entire video making it hard to heard what is being said in English.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if someone could possibly have the original video here or magically find someway to remove the Russian dub so we can hear the entire video in English
