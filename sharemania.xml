This took me two hours to rip.<br>
<br>
Nicki's website put out an exclusive stream of her song "Bahm Bahm" from her upcoming album <i>Pink Friday 2</i>. The song was hosted by Ustudio, and quite had some protection. Through yt-dlp's referring tool and ffmpeg's codec correcting tool, here's the direct rip.<br>
<br>
While poking around, I found that the original file name for the file that was put up for stream was "Bahm Bahm_9.8-(multi mix).mp3". So this is technically lossy, but was converted to FLAC to prevent more quality degradation.<br>
<br>
Here's the generation for transparency: MP3 &gt; WEB &gt; MP4 [mismatched MPEG-TS/AAC stream] &gt; MP4 [corrected audio stream] &gt; AAC &gt; WAV &gt; FLAC. This AAC &gt; WAV option produced far more quality than my MP4 [corrected audio stream] &gt; FLAC situation.<br>
<br>
This is an upgrade of previously uploaded YouTube videos where the audio was blown out.<br>
