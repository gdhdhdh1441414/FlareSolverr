Hi is it possible someone can please re-upload the complete Miley Cyrus May 26th 2017 Today show performance? Needless to say I had to get a new phone and don't have the video anymore. So if possible can someone please re-upload it. Last year or so I posted a request but the link for the video doesn't work. <br>
<br>
Any help would be appreciated, thanks and have a great day.

Hi is it possible if someone can please re-upload the complete Miley Cyrus today show may 26th 2017 performance? I made a request forum last year and the link for the upload doesn't work anymore. Needless to say I had it on my older phone but had to get a newer phone so it didn't transfer over properly. Any re-upload would be appreciated. Thanks and have a great week.<br>
