<blockquote class="quoteContainer"><div class="quote">Yours Truly is the debut studio album by American singer Ariana Grande. It was released on August 30, 2013, by Republic Records. The album's songs were recorded over nearly a three-year period, with Harmony Samuels, Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Patrick "J. Que" Smith and Grande's Victorious co-star Leon Thomas III, as well as others, handling the album's music production. Featured collaborators include Big Sean, Mika, Mac Miller, and The Wanted's Nathan Sykes.<br>
<br>
Yours Truly draws stylistic influences off the music of Grande's artistic inspirations, including singers Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey. Musically, Yours Truly is a pop and R&amp;B record, while incorporating 1990s hip hop, 1950s piano pop, and doo-wop music within its production. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that, with the help of Babyface, Grande was able to "re-create the vibe and feel of the '90s" with the album. It was acclaimed by critics upon release, with praise for Grande's vocals.<br>
<br>
Yours Truly debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart, with over 138,000 units sold in its first week. It made Grande the fifteenth female artist to ever debut at number-one in the United States with her debut album. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also garnered top ten peaks in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Yours Truly was featured in the Billboard 200 year-end charts of both 2013 and 2014.<br>
<br>
The album was preceded by the release of the lead single, "The Way", on March 25, 2013. It became a top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number nine. The second single, "Baby I", was released on August 5, 2013, and peaked at number 21 on the Hot 100. The third single, "Popular Song", was released on August 13, 2013, and peaked at number 87 on the Hot 100. The fourth and final single, "Right There", was released on August 6, 2013, and reached number 84 in the US. Yours Truly was further promoted with live renditions of the album's songs during The Listening Sessions tour in 2013.</div><div class="quoteExpand quoteCut">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>
