<blockquote class="quoteContainer"><div class="quote">The Greatest Showman: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the film The Greatest Showman. It was released in full on December 8, 2017, by Atlantic Records. The album contains all of the film's musical numbers, but none of the film's underscore. The first pre-order release was on October 26, 2017, with two promotional singles: "The Greatest Show" and "This Is Me". A third, "Rewrite the Stars", followed on November 17, 2017. "This Is Me" was released on December 8, 2017, as the album's official lead single. In Australia, "Rewrite the Stars" was released to radio on July 20, 2018.<br>
<br>
Produced by Greg Wells, Justin Paul and Benj Pasek, the album became a global success following the release of the film, topping the charts in several countries including the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and Japan. The album also reached number one on iTunes in over 77 countries. In the United Kingdom, the album was a commercial success and was the best-selling album of 2018. It became only the second album in 30 years to spend 11 consecutive weeks at number 1 and, in its 20th week atop the UK Albums Chart, it became the longest-running soundtrack at number 1 in 50 years. With combined sales of over 1.6 million, it was 2018's best-selling album in the United Kingdom. It was also the best-selling album of 2018 in the United States, with 1,491,000 in pure album sales, but third at 2,499,000 in album equivalent units.<br>
<br>
The album's single "This Is Me" won Best Original Song – Motion Picture at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, and was nominated for Best Song at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards and Best Original Song at the 90th Academy Awards. The album received positive reviews and has sold over 5.3 million copies worldwide. The album also won the Grammy Award for "Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media" at 61st Annual Grammy Awards.</div><div class="quoteExpand quoteCut">Click to expand...</div></blockquote>
