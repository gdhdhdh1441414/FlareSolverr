Hi all,<br>
<br>
I enjoy many genres of music. Most of it is digital of course, but I also have a turntable with many 80s-90s records, and my car still has a working cassette player. If I had to choose a favorite genre, I enjoy 2000s - 2010s dance/club music the most.<br>
Only problem is there's almost no nightclubs left in UK!<br>
<br>
<b>Why is that my username?</b><br>
Music in the UK is very strictly edited. As weird as it sounds, I want my music radio edited properly. Sometimes, the officially released radio edit isn't good enough. I hate it when I buy a song, and it isn't the same as what it would sound like on the radio. That's where I will dedicate time making it so, even if it takes hours to do so.<br>
<br>
