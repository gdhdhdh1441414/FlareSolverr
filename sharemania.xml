"<b>What's Love Got to Do with It</b>" is a song written by Graham Lyle and Terry Britten, and recorded by Tina Turner for her fifth studio album, <i>Private Dancer</i> (1984). Capitol Records released it as a single from <i>Private Dancer</i> in May 1984 and it eventually became Turner's biggest-selling single.<br>
<br>
Although Turner had already scored a late-1983 top 30 hit with her rendition of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together", "What's Love Got to Do with It" became her first and only <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one single, selling over 2,000,000 copies worldwide. At the time, aged 44, Turner became the oldest solo female artist to top the Hot 100. It was the second-biggest single of 1984 in the United States and the 17th-biggest in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. "What's Love Got to Do with It" received three awards at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. In 1993, the song's title was used as the title for the biographical film based on Turner's life.<br>
<br>
The accompanying music video, directed by Mark Robinson, features Turner walking down the street in a leather miniskirt, engaging with the public, intercut with scenes where she is singing directly to camera. The video was shot in New York City during the spring of 1984. Pamela Springsteen, Bruce Springsteen's sister from <i>Sleepaway Camp 2</i>, makes an appearance as a street dancer along with Vanessa Bell Calloway, who would later portray the fictional character of Jackie (Turner's friend) in the 1993 film <i>What's Love Got to Do with It</i>. - In 1985 it claimed a prize at the MTV Video Music Awards for "Best Female Video".<br>
<br>
An alternate black-and-white video directed by Bud Schaetzle features Tina singing the song against a black background while couples argue in a bar.<br>
