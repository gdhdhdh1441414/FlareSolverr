Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:16.99] The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm, and I'm a house of cards / [00:24.43] You're the kind of reckless that should send me running / [00:28.68] But I kinda know that I won't get far / [00:33.71] And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch / [00:42.26] Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of / [00:48.55] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain / [00:54.16] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / [00:58.23] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile / [01:05.75] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down / [01:10.53] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around / [01:14.92] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile / [01:25.93] / [01:32.15] My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea / [01:40.40] You touch me once and it's really something / [01:43.90] You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be / [01:48.71] I'm on my guard for the rest of the world, but with you, I know it's no good / [01:57.12] And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would / [02:03.73] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain / [02:09.49] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / [02:13.49] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile / [02:20.88] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down / [02:25.65] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around / [02:30.00] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile / [02:40.61] / [02:46.73] I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild / [02:55.04] Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right / [03:03.37] And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow? / [03:11.79] I'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show / [03:18.78] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain / [03:24.50] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / [03:28.39] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile / [03:35.96] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down / [03:40.75] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around / [03:45.29] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile / [03:57.19] And the sparks fly / [04:00.74] And, oh, baby, smile / [04:05.50] And the sparks fly / [04:09.06] <br>

Tell me, how's your family? / [00:20.99] I haven't seen them in a while / [00:27.42] You've been good, busier than ever / [00:30.76] We small talk, work and the weather / [00:34.48] Your guard is up and I know why / [00:40.95] Because the last time you saw me / [00:43.66] Is still burned in the back of your mind / [00:46.90] You gave me roses and I left them there to die / [00:53.97] So this is me swallowin' my pride / [00:56.73] Standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night / [01:03.00] And I go back to December all the time / [01:07.57] It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you / [01:11.25] Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine / [01:16.82] I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright / [01:23.50] I go back to December all the time / [01:29.08] / [01:42.15] These days, I haven't been sleepin' / [01:44.92] Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin' / [01:48.57] When your birthday passed and I didn't call / [01:54.61] Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times / [01:58.36] I watched you laughin' from the passenger side and / [02:02.28] Realized I loved you in the fall / [02:08.89] And then the cold came, the dark days / [02:11.67] When fear crept into my mind / [02:14.80] You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye / [02:21.93] So this is me swallowin' my pride / [02:24.62] Standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night / [02:31.11] And I go back to December all the time / [02:35.58] It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you / [02:39.11] Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine / [02:44.85] I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind / [02:51.45] I go back to December all the time / [02:56.38] / [03:08.25] I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile / [03:12.35] So good to me, so right / [03:15.18] And how you held me in your arms that September night / [03:19.82] The first time you ever saw me cry / [03:23.72] Maybe this is wishful thinkin' / [03:27.23] Probably mindless dreamin' / [03:29.88] But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right / [03:35.93] I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't / [03:42.60] So if the chain is on your door, I understand / [03:49.92] But this is me swallowin' my pride / [03:52.63] Standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night / [03:58.88] And I go back to December / [04:03.37] It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you / [04:06.95] Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine / [04:12.69] I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright / [04:19.34] I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind / [04:26.37] I go back to December all the time / [04:32.78] / [04:36.27] All the time / [04:37.64] <br>

Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:03.95] I am not the kind of girl / [00:07.38] Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion / [00:11.83] But you are not the kind of boy / [00:15.42] Who should be marrying the wrong girl / [00:20.23] I sneak in and see your friends / [00:23.68] And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel / [00:27.84] And she is yelling at a bridesmaid / [00:31.70] Somewhere back inside a room, wearing a gown shaped like a pastry / [00:36.32] This is surely not what you thought it would be / [00:44.43] I lose myself in a daydream / [00:50.68] Where I stand and say / [00:52.97] Don't say yes, run away now / [00:56.15] I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door / [01:01.09] Don't wait or say a single vow / [01:04.33] You need to hear me out, and they said, "Speak now" / [01:09.16] / [01:16.77] Fond gestures are exchanged / [01:20.16] And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march / [01:24.45] And I am hiding in the curtains / [01:28.03] It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be / [01:32.85] She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen / [01:40.64] But I know you wish it was me / [01:46.50] You wish it was me, don't you? / [01:49.46] Don't say yes, run away now / [01:52.67] I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door / [01:57.51] Don't wait or say a single vow / [02:00.78] You need to hear me out, and they said, "Speak now" / [02:05.55] Don't say yes, run away now (run away now) / [02:08.81] I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door / [02:13.64] Don't wait, or say a single vow (say a single vow) / [02:16.81] Your time is running out, and they said, "Speak now" / [02:23.17] Ooh (run away) now / [02:31.39] Ooh (say a single vow), ooh / [02:37.49] I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace" / [02:45.39] There's the silence, there's my last chance / [02:47.42] I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me / [02:53.53] Horrified looks from everyone in the room / [02:57.18] But I'm only looking at you / [03:01.65] I am not the kind of girl / [03:04.84] Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion / [03:09.21] But you are not the kind of boy / [03:12.89] Who should be marrying the wrong girl / [03:17.82] So don't say yes, run away now / [03:21.49] I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door / [03:26.16] Don't wait or say a single vow / [03:29.42] You need to hear me out, they said, "Speak now" / [03:34.11] You'll say, "Let's run away now (run away now) / [03:37.62] I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door / [03:42.39] Baby, I didn't say my vows (say a single vow) / [03:45.77] So glad you were around when they said, 'Speak now'" / [03:52.15] <br>

Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:24.23] Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you / [00:36.39] Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through again / [00:47.75] And my mother accused me of losing my mind / [00:53.56] But I swore I was fine / [01:00.41] You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain / [01:11.48] And I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day / [01:24.47] Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight / [01:35.99] Well, I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why / [01:47.11] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone / [01:57.60] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? / [02:03.22] The girl in the dress cried the whole way home / [02:12.09] I should've known / [02:14.25] / [02:24.47] Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame / [02:35.72] Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love, then take it away / [02:48.33] And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand / [02:59.75] And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said, "Run as fast as you can" / [03:11.90] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone / [03:21.91] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? / [03:27.64] The girl in the dress cried the whole way home / [03:36.10] Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong / [03:46.04] Don't you think 19's too young to be played / [03:51.13] By your dark, twisted games when I loved you so? / [04:00.57] I should've known / [04:03.19] / [04:11.71] You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry / [04:19.23] Never impressed by me acing your tests / [04:24.32] All the girls that you've run dry have tired, lifeless eyes / [04:30.33] 'Cause you burned them out / [04:37.21] But I took your matches before fire could catch me / [04:42.84] So don't look now / [04:49.18] I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town / [05:05.90] Oh, oh / [05:18.68] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone / [05:28.58] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? / [05:34.15] The girl in the dress cried the whole way home / [05:46.44] I see it all now that you're gone / [05:52.59] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? / [05:58.25] The girl in the dress wrote you a song / [06:06.92] You should've known / [06:13.09] You should've known / [06:16.50] / [06:22.75] Don't you think I was too young? / [06:29.72] You should've known / [06:32.12] <br>

Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:17.49] I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us / [00:21.13] How we met and the sparks flew instantly / [00:24.72] And people would say, "They're the lucky ones" / [00:31.17] I used to know my place was the spot next to you / [00:34.82] Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat / [00:38.03] 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on / [00:44.64] Oh, a simple complication / [00:47.03] Miscommunications lead to fall out / [00:51.59] So many things that I wish you knew / [00:54.99] So many walls up, I can't break through / [00:58.69] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room / [01:02.06] And we're not speaking / [01:05.77] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah / [01:12.43] I don't know what to say since the twist of fate / [01:15.94] When it all broke down / [01:18.35] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now / [01:25.02] Next chapter / [01:25.94] / [01:33.07] How'd we end up this way? / [01:34.78] See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy / [01:39.80] And you're doing your best to avoid me / [01:46.34] I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us / [01:50.10] How I was losing my mind when I saw you here / [01:53.57] But you held your pride like you should've held me / [01:59.86] Oh, I'm scared to see the ending / [02:02.57] Why are we pretending this is nothing? / [02:06.87] I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how / [02:10.33] I've never heard silence quite this loud / [02:14.00] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room / [02:17.43] And we're not speaking / [02:20.90] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah / [02:27.72] I don't know what to say since the twist of fate / [02:31.43] When it all broke down / [02:33.94] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now / [02:38.45] / [02:55.34] This is looking like a contest / [02:58.51] Of who can act like they care less / [03:01.76] But I liked it better when you were on my side / [03:09.08] The battle's in your hands now / [03:12.56] But I would lay my armor down / [03:15.19] If you said you'd rather love than fight / [03:22.47] So many things that you wish I knew / [03:25.45] But the story of us might be ending soon / [03:29.58] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room / [03:32.84] And we're not speaking / [03:36.32] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah / [03:43.12] I don't know what to say since the twist of fate / [03:46.68] When it all broke down / [03:49.17] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now / [04:00.34] And we're not speaking / [04:03.86] And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah / [04:10.55] I don't know what to say since the twist of fate / [04:14.04] 'Cause we're going down / [04:16.80] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now / [04:22.57] The end / [04:23.51] <br>

Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:13.23] There I was again tonight / [00:16.25] Forcing laughter, faking smiles / [00:19.14] Same old tired, lonely place / [00:24.90] Walls of insincerity / [00:27.76] Shifting eyes and vacancy / [00:30.77] Vanished when I saw your face / [00:34.31] All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you / [00:44.78] / [00:48.48] Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" / [00:51.35] Across the room, your silhouette / [00:54.11] Starts to make its way to me / [00:59.93] The playful conversation starts / [01:02.81] Counter all your quick remarks / [01:05.57] Like passing notes in secrecy / [01:10.99] And it was enchanting to meet you / [01:21.09] All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you / [01:30.78] / [01:35.99] This night is sparkling, don't you let it go / [01:41.92] I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home / [01:47.73] I'll spend forever wondering if you knew / [01:53.18] I was enchanted to meet you / [01:57.90] / [02:04.45] The lingering question kept me up / [02:07.44] 2 a.m., who do you love? / [02:10.30] I wonder 'til I'm wide awake / [02:16.19] And now I'm pacing back and forth / [02:19.12] Wishing you were at my door / [02:21.98] I'd open up and you would say / [02:26.45] "Hey, it was enchanting to meet you" / [02:33.36] / [02:37.42] All I know is I was enchanted to meet you / [02:47.81] / [02:51.91] This night is sparkling, don't you let it go / [02:58.02] I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home / [03:03.69] I'll spend forever wondering if you knew / [03:12.63] / [03:15.57] This night is flawless, don't you let it go / [03:21.35] I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone / [03:27.14] I'll spend forever wondering if you knew / [03:32.61] I was enchanted to meet you / [03:37.66] / [03:58.65] This is me praying that / [04:02.00] This was the very first page / [04:04.98] Not where the story line ends / [04:07.86] My thoughts will echo your name / [04:10.68] Until I see you again / [04:13.74] These are the words I held back / [04:16.58] As I was leaving too soon / [04:19.62] I was enchanted to meet you / [04:25.15] Please don't be in love with someone else / [04:30.76] Please don't have somebody waiting on you / [04:36.61] Please don't be in love with someone else / [04:42.55] Please don't have somebody waiting on you / [04:49.15] This night is sparkling, don't you let it go / [04:54.93] I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home / [05:00.88] I'll spend forever wondering if you knew / [05:09.16] / [05:12.54] This night is flawless, don't you let it go / [05:18.49] I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone / [05:24.22] I'll spend forever wondering if you knew / [05:29.94] I was enchanted to meet you / [05:35.38] Please don't be in love with someone else / [05:41.15] Please don't have somebody waiting on you / [05:45.31] <br>

Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:16.78] I said, "Remember this moment" / [00:21.76] In the back of my mind / [00:26.13] The time we stood with our shaking hands / [00:29.83] The crowds in stands went wild / [00:35.65] We were the kings and the queens / [00:40.57] And they read off our names / [00:45.05] The night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same / [00:54.59] You held your head like a hero / [00:59.38] On a history book page / [01:03.83] It was the end of a decade / [01:08.86] But the start of an age / [01:12.53] / [01:14.71] Long live the walls we crashed through / [01:18.37] How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you / [01:22.78] I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made / [01:27.41] And bring on all the pretenders" / [01:30.87] One day, we will be remembered / [01:36.70] I said, "Remember this feeling" / [01:41.55] I passed the pictures around / [01:46.24] Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines / [01:51.56] Wishing for right now / [01:55.67] We are the kings and the queens / [01:59.37] You traded your baseball cap for a crown / [02:05.24] When they gave us our trophies / [02:08.47] And we held them up for our town / [02:14.77] And the cynics were outraged / [02:19.39] Screaming, "This is absurd" / [02:23.83] 'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans / [02:29.73] Got to rule the world / [02:34.99] Long live the walls we crashed through / [02:38.16] How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you / [02:42.82] I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made / [02:47.47] And bring on all the pretenders" / [02:50.72] I'm not afraid / [02:53.46] Long live all the mountains we moved / [02:56.80] I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you / [03:01.77] I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face / [03:06.33] And bring on all the pretenders" / [03:09.66] One day, we will be remembered / [03:15.10] / [03:17.86] Hold on to spinning around / [03:21.71] Confetti falls to the ground / [03:26.39] May these memories break our fall / [03:35.43] Will you take a moment? / [03:40.02] Promise me this / [03:43.97] That you'll stand by me forever / [03:47.52] But if, God forbid, fate should step in / [03:53.33] And force us into a goodbye / [03:58.14] If you have children some day / [04:03.03] When they point to the pictures / [04:07.49] Please, tell 'em my name / [04:11.07] / [04:13.09] Tell 'em how the crowds went wild / [04:17.69] Tell 'em how I hope they shine / [04:22.96] Long live the walls we crashed through / [04:26.36] I had the time of my life, with you / [04:32.23] Long, long live the walls we crashed through / [04:35.85] How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you / [04:40.44] And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made / [04:45.12] And bring on all the pretenders" / [04:48.38] I'm not afraid / [04:50.78] Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved / [04:54.60] I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you" / [04:59.84] And long, long live that look on your face / [05:03.90] And bring on all the pretenders / [05:07.57] One day / [05:11.57] We will be remembered / [05:12.59] <br>

Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:29.70] Once I had an empire in a golden age / [00:36.39] I was held up so high, I used to be great / [00:42.57] They used to cheer when they saw my face / [00:49.32] Now I fear, I have fallen from grace / [00:54.53] And I feel like my castle's crumbling down / [01:01.42] And I watched all my bridges burn to the ground / [01:07.71] And you don't want to know me, I would just let you down / [01:16.33] / [01:19.69] You don't wanna know me now / [01:24.26] / [01:34.62] Once I was the great hope for a dynasty / [01:41.13] Crowds would hang on my words, and they trusted me / [01:47.48] Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far / [01:53.75] I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart / [02:00.63] Power went to my head, and I couldn't stop / [02:07.12] Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off / [02:13.48] And here I sit alone behind walls of regret / [02:19.80] Falling down like promises that I never kept / [02:25.10] And I feel like my castle's crumbling down / [02:32.03] And I watched all my bridges burn to the ground / [02:38.66] And you don't want to know me / [02:43.87] I would just let you down / [02:50.49] You don't wanna know me now / [02:53.95] / [03:18.72] My foes and friends watched my reign end / [03:25.18] I don't know how it could've ended this way / [03:31.29] Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor / [03:34.56] People look at me like I'm a monster / [03:37.93] Now they're screaming at the palace front gates / [03:40.24] Used to chant my name / [03:41.75] Now they're screaming that they hate me / [03:45.42] / [03:48.47] Never wanted you to hate me / [03:52.85] My castle's crumbling down / [03:56.49] And I watched all my bridges burn to the ground / [04:03.19] And you don't want to know me / [04:08.34] I would just let you down (just let you down) / [04:14.46] My castle's crumbling down / [04:17.35] / [04:21.11] You don't wanna know me now / [04:23.34] <br>

Lyrics : [00:00.00] / [00:14.31] Down the block there's an antique shop / [00:17.27] And something in my head said "stop", so I walked in / [00:20.94] On the counter was a cardboard box / [00:23.57] And the sign said photos 25 cents each / [00:27.86] Black and white saw a 30s bride and / [00:30.71] Two lovers laughing on the porch of their first house / [00:34.40] The kind of love that you only find once in a lifetime / [00:38.53] The kind you don't put down / [00:40.92] And that's when I called you, and it's so hard to explain / [00:46.67] But in those photos, I saw us instead / [00:54.23] And somehow I know that you and I would've found each other / [01:01.03] In another life you still would've turned my head / [01:05.44] Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944 / [01:11.14] And you were headed off to fight in the war / [01:14.60] You still would've been mine / [01:16.40] We would've been timeless / [01:20.60] I would've read your love letters every single night / [01:24.66] And prayed to God you'd be coming home all right / [01:28.17] And you would've been fine, we would've been timeless / [01:34.44] 'Cause I believe we that we were supposed to find this / [01:39.14] So even in a different life / [01:41.34] You still would've been mine / [01:43.43] We would've been timeless / [01:58.38] I had to smile when it caught my eye / [02:00.98] There was one of a teenage couple in a driveway / [02:05.01] Holding hands on the way to a dance / [02:07.65] And the date on the back said 1958 / [02:11.51] Which brought me back to the first time I saw you / [02:14.68] Time stood still like something in this old shop / [02:18.27] I thought about it as I started looking 'round / [02:21.17] At these precious things that time forgot / [02:25.08] That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs / [02:31.33] Story of a romance torn apart by fate / [02:38.60] Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love like we did / [02:45.13] And I'd die for you in the same way / [02:49.31] If I first saw your face / [02:51.42] In the 1500s up in a foreign land / [02:55.03] And I was forced to marry another man / [02:58.44] You still would've been mine / [03:00.54] We would've been timeless / [03:04.22] I would've read your love letters every single night / [03:08.67] And run away and left it all behind / [03:12.08] You still would've been mine / [03:13.96] We would've been timeless / [03:18.40] 'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this / [03:23.37] So even in a different life / [03:25.45] You still would've been mine / [03:27.28] We would've been timeless / [03:31.18] / [03:42.05] Time breaks down your mind and body / [03:48.63] Don't you let it touch your soul / [03:54.83] It was like an age old classic / [03:58.79] The first time that you saw me / [04:01.97] The story started when you said hello / [04:08.54] In a crowded room a few short years ago / [04:12.26] And sometimes there's no proof, you just know / [04:15.85] You're always gonna be mine / [04:18.05] We're gonna be / [04:21.80] I'm gonna love you when our hair is turning gray / [04:25.26] We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we made / [04:29.42] And you'll say "Oh my" / [04:31.08] We really were timeless / [04:34.73] We're gonna be timeless, timeless / [04:42.48] You still would've been mine, we would've been / [04:47.22] Even if we met / [04:48.85] On a crowded street in 1944 / [04:56.22] Still would've been mine / [04:58.31] You would've been / [05:03.07] Down the block there's an antique shop / [05:05.87] And something in my head said "stop", so I walked in / [05:10.25] <br>
