I'm trying to train my own AI super-resolution model, and I decided to use Whitney's movies as sources for training. The thing is, I managed to download the high quality (some of them BDRemux) movies in torrent, but couldn't find them ripped from VHS, which would be perfect to use as the LQ input for the AI. The movies are:<br>
- The Bodyguard (1992)<br>
- Waiting to Exhale (1995)<br>
- The Preacher's Wife (1996)<br>
- Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997)<br>
If you have any of these in VHSRip, please share! My plan is to use my AI model to upscale mostly Whitney's live performances, many of which were captured as TVRips that were recorded on VHS and then digitized.
