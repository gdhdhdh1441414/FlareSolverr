"<b>Fast Car</b>" is a song by American singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman. It was released on April 6, 1988, as the lead single from her 1988 self-titled debut studio album. Chapman's appearance on the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute helped the song become a top-ten hit in the United States, reaching number six on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, it initially reached number five on the UK Singles Chart in 1988.<br>
"Fast Car" received three Grammy Award nominations: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, the latter of which it won. It also received an MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Female Video in 1989.<br>
<br>
American country music singer and songwriter <b>Luke Combs</b> released a version of the song on his 2023 album <i>Gettin' Old</i>. It was sent to US Top 40 and Hot AC radio as the second single from the album, marking the first time that Combs has had a song sent to contemporary hit radio, as well as the first single that he did not have a hand in writing.<br>
<br>
Combs' version uses Chapman's original lyrics including the line "I work in the market as a checkout girl". Combs' manager Chris Kappy told <i>Billboard</i> magazine, "Luke is a songwriter too and Tracy is one of his favorite artists. So his goal was to never change the song. His goal was to honor the perfection that it is, and changing the gender never crossed his mind."<br>
<br>
In an interview with <i>Billboard</i>, Chapman spoke favorably of Combs and his rendition of "Fast Car", stating, "I never expected to find myself on the country charts, but I’m honored to be there. I’m happy for Luke and his success and grateful that new fans have found and embraced 'Fast Car.'" According to <i>Billboard</i>, Chapman earned about $500,000 in publishing royalties in the first few months of the release.<br>
<br>
Combs' version of "Fast Car" became a smash hit at radio, reaching number two on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, higher than Chapman's original version, and on the Canadian Hot 100. On the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart dated August 5, 2023, it sat at number three, behind Jason Aldean's "Try That in a Small Town" and Morgan Wallen's "Last Night" at numbers one and two, respectively, making it the first time in that chart's history that the top three positions were all occupied by country artists.<br>
<br>
The song reached number one on the Country Airplay chart in July 2023, making Chapman the first black woman to score a country number one with a solo composition. Additionally, it became the first cover of a pop single to top a <i>Billboard</i> chart based on country radio airplay since Blake Shelton's version of Michael Bublé's 2005 single "Home" reached number one in 2008. On the Country Airplay chart dated September 9, 2023, it held the number two position behind Combs' own "Love You Anyway" at the top, making it the first time in that chart's history that the top two positions were simultaneously occupied by a solo act with no accompanying acts, and only the second time that such a distinction has been achieved by any act overall.<br>
<br>
<b>Release Info</b><br>
The video track is upscaled from 1080p to 4K with Topaz Video AI and encoded to HEVC 10-bit.<br>
The PCM tracks are lossless, downloaded from Qobuz (24-bit 48 kHz) and synced with Adobe Audition.<br>
The lip-syncing of the album version (2nd) is so perfect that it's probably created from the live version.<br>
The timed lyrics are synced &amp; edited. Enable the subtitles to see the lyrics.<br>
