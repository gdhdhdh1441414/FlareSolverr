Lyrics : I met you in the dark / You lit me up / You made me feel as though / I was enough / We danced the night away / We drank too much / I held your hair back when / You were throwing up / / Then you smiled over your shoulder / For a minute, I was stone cold sober / I pulled you closer to my chest / And you asked me to stay over / I said, "I already told ya / I think that you should get some rest" / / I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know / 'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go / I knew I needed you, but I never showed / But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old / Just say you won't let go / Just say you won't let go / / I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed / I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head / And I'll take the kids to school / Wave them goodbye / And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night / / When you looked over your shoulder / For a minute, I forget that I'm older / I wanna dance with you right now, oh / And you look as beautiful as ever / And I swear that everyday you'll get better / You make me feel this way somehow / / I'm so in love with you / And I hope you know / Darling, your love is more than what its weight in gold / We've come so far my dear / Look how we've grown / And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old / Just say you won't let go / Just say you won't let go / / I wanna live with you / Even when we're ghosts / 'Cause you were always there for me / When I needed you most / / I'm gonna love you 'til my lungs give out / I promise 'til death we part like in our vows / So I wrote this song for you / Now everybody knows / That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old / Just say you won't let go / Just say you won't let go / / Just say you won't let go / Oh, just say you won't let go
