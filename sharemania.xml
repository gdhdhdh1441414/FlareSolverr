Lyrics                         : I could do this with my eyes closed /  / I'm back from the dead / From the back of my head / Been gone and facing horrors / That should never be said / The wrath and the grit / From the pit of despair / Been taking every whip and word / I've never been spared /  / They say tomorrow's never promised, honest / They say the angels are among us /  / Lock me up in a maze / Turn out, turn out the lights / I was born, I was raised for this / Turn out, turn out the lights / Turn out the lights /  / Lock me up inside a cage / Just throw away the key / Don't worry 'bout me / I was driving in my car, throwing up my hands / Put it in coast /  / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes — /  / Less medications, less manifestations / Mantras, meditation, throw it all away /  / All the places I've been / All the blood that I've bled / I've been broken down and beat up / But I still get ahead / All the faceless embraces / And the tasteless two faces / Killed and resurrected / 'Cause I'll never be dead /  / They say tomorrow's never promised, honest / They say that piranhas are among us /  / Lock me up in a maze / Turn out, turn out the lights / I was born, I was raised for this / Turn out, turn out the lights / Turn out the lights /  / Lock me up inside a cage / Just throw away the key / Don't worry 'bout me / I was driving in my car, throwing up my hands / Put it in coast /  / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes— /  / And when the day broke, buried in violence / Something made my mind up / I will spend these days as an island / Alone and far away /  / Lock me up in a maze / Turn out, turn out the lights / I was born, I was raised for this / Turn out, turn out the lights /  / Lock me up inside a cage / Just throw away the key / Don't worry 'bout me / I was driving in my car throwing up my hands / Put it in coast /  / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes closed / Turn out, turn out the lights / I could do this with my eyes closed
