Hello there. Is it possible to upload some episodes of this game show from Nick/Amazon/Google Play/iTunes/YouTube TV or any similar platform? It would be nice to have some episodes with Jerry Trainor as a host. Obviously, 2-3 episodes are just enough to have an idea about that show. I am from a country where none of these services are available and Nickelodeon CIS has never broadcasted game shows, that is why I am curious about it. Thanks in advance.
