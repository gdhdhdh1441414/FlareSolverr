I've been trying to find a high quality version of this song EVERYWHERE. Every file i find ends up having a questionable quality. A couple years back a high quality audio of this song was uploaded to youtube. It was a CD RIP. The quality was amazing, but the video was deleted for copyright reasons. I wanna now if a real high quality file exists somewhere, maybe even an OG file, although i doubt one exists. I'm satisfied with a 320kpbs file. Could anyone help me out?
