anyone has the good quality of this old gem? its a staple on every 80s-90s Chinese wedding in INDONESIA. its so nostalgic.<br>
I know there are many Indonesian users here, I hope any of you could help. <br>
I need the English version, The Wedding (from album of the same title - The Wedding , it's also on some old 60s compilation vinyl and album. im sure this was very popular back then at least in parts of Asia.<br>
Julie Rogers also has a version, but that isn't the well known version we used back home. <br>
the original Spanish version La Novia is way easier to find, I just cannot find the English version and the YouTube vid available is poor quality audio<br>
<br>
thank you
