"<b>Dust in the Wind</b>" is a song recorded by American progressive rock band Kansas and written by band member Kerry Livgren, first released on their 1977 album <i>Point of Know Return</i>.<br>
<br>
Kerry Livgren devised what would be the guitar line for "Dust in the Wind" as a finger exercise for learning fingerpicking. His wife, Vicci, heard what he was doing, remarked that the melody was nice, and encouraged him to write lyrics for it.<br>
The title of the song is a Bible reference. The phrase "dust in the wind" occurs in Psalms 18:42 ("I ground [my enemies] like dust on the face of the wind..."). It is similar to the famous opening lines of the Japanese war epic <i>The Tale of the Heike</i> ("...the mighty fall at last, and they are as dust before the wind.") and from a book of Native American poetry, which includes the line "for all we are is dust in the wind."<br>
Livgren was unsure whether his fellow band members would like it, since it was a departure from their signature style. After Kansas had rehearsed all the songs intended for the band's recording sessions of June and July 1976, Livgren played "Dust in the Wind" for his bandmates, who after a moment's "stunned silence" asked: <i>"Kerry, where has this been?"</i> Kansas guitarist Rich Williams would recall that Livgren played his bandmates <i>"a real rough recording of him playing 'Dust in the Wind' on an old reel to reel. He just kind of mumbled the lyrics, but even hearing it in that bare form...we said: 'That's our next single.'"</i><br>
<br>
Recorded at Woodland Studios in Nashville, "Dust in the Wind" featured Livgren playing a Martin D-28 acoustic guitar borrowed from Williams: highlighted by the electric violin work of Robby Steinhardt, the track featured Steve Walsh as lead vocalist.<br>
<br>
The song peaked at No. 6 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 the week of April 22, 1978, making it Kansas's only single to reach the top ten in the US. The 45-rpm single was certified Gold for sales of one million units by the RIAA shortly after the height of its popularity as a hit single. The song was certified 3x Platinum by the RIAA on November 26, 2019, which makes it the second song by the band to reach platinum after "Carry on Wayward Son."<br>
