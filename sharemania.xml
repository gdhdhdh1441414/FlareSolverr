"<b>Californication</b>" is a song by by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's the sixth track and fourth single from the band's seventh studio album of the same name, released on June 8, 1999. The song reached no.1 on the Billboard Alternative chart and the 3rd track to reach the top spot from the album. When it was released, Flea called Californication "the best record the Chili Peppers have ever made."<br>
<br>
"Californication" is a song about the deterioration of society, this reflects how the world is becoming very superficial and plastic, much like California. The Red Hot Chili Peppers formed in Hollywood and are quite familiar with the quirky nature of life in Los Angeles. As written in the dictionary, "fornication" refers disapprovingly to any sexual activity outside the confines of marriage.<br>
The lyrics, "Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off station to station and Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication," get in a few pop-culture references: Kurt Cobain, David Bowie's album Station To Station, and Alderaan - the planet Princess Leia was from in <i>Star Wars</i>. Alderaan was destroyed by The Empire, implying that the world is being destroyed.<br>
The lyrics, "Celebrity skin is this your chin, or is that war your waging," get in a reference to Celebrity Skin, the third and final album from the band Hole. Hole was formed by Courtney Love, Kurt Cobain's wife.<br>
<br>
The music video mixed live footage with a simulated video game where each band member is on a different virtual adventure. This wasn't easy to do in 1999, when computer modeling was still rudimentary. It looks very dated, but the concept was innovative, predating <i>Ready Player One</i> by 19 years. The directors were Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who were storytellers, not virtual effects artists. They went on to direct the films <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i> (2006) and <i>Battle Of The Sexes</i> (2017).<br>
<br>
Californication became the Chili Peppers 2nd song to reach over 1 billion streams on Spotify. It was also their first song to have over 1 billion views on YouTube.<br>
