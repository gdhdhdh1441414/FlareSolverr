Hello, I'm looking for someone to rip the Nickelodeon dub of Winx Club from Prime Video, specifically Seasons 3, 4, and the TV Specials. The iTunes Versions have been mostly taken down (the specials remain), but it remains up on Prime Video for purchase. I am not sure how long it will be up for since Rainbow has purchased Viacom's share in them back.<br>
<br>
Specials: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0058LHXF6/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s0" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0058LHXF6/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s0</a><br>
Season 3 Part 1: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00689RD16/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s1" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00689RD16/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s1</a><br>
Season 3 Part 2: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B006M6FZ56/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s2" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B006M6FZ56/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s2</a><br>
Season 4 Part 1: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0081HA7ZM/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s1" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0081HA7ZM/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s1</a><br>

It seems that no one posted a request for Common's albums. If anyone has a FLAC version of Common's "Be" and "Let Love" albums, I'll be eternally grateful.<br>
<br>
Thank you!
