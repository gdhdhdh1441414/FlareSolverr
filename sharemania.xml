<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Info for <i>What's Love Got to Do with It (30th Anniversary 2023 Remaster)</i></b></span><br>
<br>
<br>
Originally released on June 15, 1993, What’s Love Got To Do With It was a commercial and critical success. The album was the soundtrack for the Tina Turner biographical film of the same name and reached No.1 in the UK, also making the top 10 in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Canada, and the top 20 in the US. The album went on to be a platinum record across the world, including the US, UK and Switzerland. It was a collection of songs, some of which were re-recorded from Turner’s ‘Ike &amp; Tina Turner’ period, including “A Fool In Love,” as well as five brand new songs, one of which - “I Don't Wanna Fight" - became a top 10 hit in both the US and UK. The album also includes Turner's version of The Trammps' disco classic "Disco Inferno," a song she had often performed live in concert in the late '70s but never previously recorded in the studio. Two tracks from her 1984 breakthrough solo album Private Dancer are also included - the title track and a different re-mixed version of "I Might Have Been Queen."<br>
<br>
Turner has sold over 200 million records and has had 10 UK top 10 hit singles and nine UK top 10 albums and was the first female artist to have a top 40 hit in six consecutive decades in the UK. Her albums combined are 20x platinum in the UK and 9x platinum in the US whilst also achieving huge sales throughout the rest of the world. She has won eight Grammy® Awards and has been nominated for 25. She was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame® in 1991 and has stars on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and St. Louis Walk of Fame. Her 1988 Break Every Rule tour broke the world record for the largest paying audience at a solo concert, with 184,000 at the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro, and Rolling Stone Magazine named her No.17 on the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time and No.63 on the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<br>

<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Info for <i>Nonetheless</i></b></span><br>
<br>
<br>
The album "Nonetheless" will be released on 26.04.2024 and is the duo's first album to be produced with James Ford. Ford is known for his work with artists such as Arctic Monkeys, Depeche Mode, Blur, Gorillaz and Simian Mobile Disco. "Nonetheless" contains 10 brand new tracks that were recorded and mixed in London last year, mainly at James Ford's studio in East London. The orchestra and backing vocals were recorded at The Church Studio in North London.<br>
<br>
The music on "nonetheless" is both uplifting and reflective, musically the ten songs feature a mixture of electronics, live instruments and orchestral arrangements. As you would expect from the Pet Shop Boys, the focus is on strong melodies and their distinctive songwriting, which they combine with a fresh, open mind for new approaches. The music on "nonetheless" is both uplifting and thought-provoking, musically the ten songs feature a mixture of electronics, live instruments and orchestral arrangements. As you would expect from the Pet Shop Boys, the focus is on strong melodies and their unmistakable songwriting, which they combine with a fresh, open mind for new approaches.<br>
