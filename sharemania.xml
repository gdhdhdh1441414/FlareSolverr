"<b>Padam Padam</b>" is a song by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, taken from her upcoming sixteenth studio album <i>Tension</i>. It was released as the album's lead single on 18 May 2023 by BMG Rights Management and Minogue's company, Darenote. It was written by Norwegian singer and songwriter Ina Wroldsen together with its producer Lostboy. <br>
<br>
"Padam Padam" reached number one in Israel, the top five in Croatia, and the top 10 in Ireland and the United Kingdom, giving Minogue a top 10 single in five consecutive decades from the 1980s to the 2020s in the latter two countries. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 20 in Australia and the Netherlands, charting also in Belgium, Canada, Hungary, Russia, and Poland, as well as on component charts in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, New Zealand, and the United States. Minogue performed the single on <i>American Idol</i>, at KTUphoria in the US, and at the Capital's Summertime Ball 2023 in the UK.<br>
<br>
The term "Padam-ic" was coined by Laura Snapes of <i>The Guardian</i> to encapsulate the cultural impact of "Padam Padam", describing it as the "cultural moment in which frivolity and lightness seem to be breezing back after the pandemic and after an era in which culture has been taken very seriously".<br>
<br>
The song has been described as Minogue's biggest hit since music streaming came predominantly into the discography, being likened to the ability of Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, and Dusty Springfield to have a recording comeback after commercially less profitable periods. Other critics have observed that it is a rare occurrence for a middle-aged artist to have achieved a mediatic impact in the last decades.<br>
<br>
In an interview for <i>Variety</i>, James Masterton, a chart analyst, and historian says the success of the single is significant because Minogue has "bridged a generation gap with a hit record that is reaching out both to her loyal (and ageing) acolytes but also a new generation of music fans", the latter attracted thanks to the TikTok platform that "contributed to the explosion of Kylie's single; [...] bypassing all traditional media avenues".<br>
<br>
It also became an anthem for LGBT community in several Pride parades, including the NYC Pride March, Pride in London, and the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. The song was also recognized as the Record of the Year at the Las Culturistas Culture Award. The song was also added by William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales, to announce their participation at the London Pride.<br>
<br>
The accompanying music video was directed by Sophie Muller and released the same day as the song. It was filmed in April at the Pink Motel, a former working motel now used for film and TV shoots, in Sun Valley in Los Angeles.<br>
Inspired by the works of David Lynch and Nicolas Roeg's <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> (1976), the music video depicts Minogue as "a vampiric femme fatale in a candy-coloured Americana dreamland", according to Phoebe Luckhurst in <i>The Australian</i>. Minogue appears in a roadside diner and a junkyard wearing several striking red outfits, including a custom Mugler catsuit with a cape,flanked by dancers also dressed in red.<br>
Describing the aesthetic, Muller said the music video portrayed "a sense of otherworldliness, a strangeness" which mirrored the track, adding: "There's something unusual about [the song], a darkness and unease." Rather than shoot the video in a studio, Minogue said she wanted to film on location in the United States.<br>
