<br>
"<b>Appetite for Destruction</b>" is the debut studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, released by Geffen Records on July 21, 1987. It initially received little mainstream attention, and it was not until the following year that <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> became a commercial success, after the band had toured and received significant airplay with the singles "Welcome to the Jungle", "Paradise City", and "Sweet Child o' Mine". The album went on to peak at number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, and it became the seventh best-selling album of all time in the United States, as well as the best-selling debut album. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling albums globally.<br>
Although critics were originally ambivalent toward the album, <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> has received retrospective acclaim and been viewed as one of the greatest albums of all time.<br>
<br>
Rose stated many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that were ultimately featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for <i>Appetite for Destruction</i>, such as "Back Off Bitch", "You Could Be Mine", "November Rain", and "Don't Cry". It is said that the reason for not putting "November Rain" on <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> was that the band had already agreed to put "Sweet Child o' Mine" on the album, and thus already had a "ballad" on the track list.<br>
<br>
Many of the songs on <i>Appetite For Destruction</i> began as solo tracks that individual band members began separately from the band, only to be completed later. These songs include "It's So Easy" (Duff McKagan) and "Think About You" (Izzy Stradlin). "Rocket Queen" was an unfinished Slash/McKagan/Adler song from their earlier band Road Crew, and "Anything Goes", written by Hollywood Rose and included on their compilation album <i>The Roots of Guns N' Roses</i>, was re-written for <i>Appetite</i>. Most of the songs reflect the band's personal experiences and daily life, such as "Welcome to the Jungle", some of the lyrics of which Rose wrote after he encountered a man in New York shortly after arriving there from Indiana in 1980, and "Mr. Brownstone", which is about the band's problems with heroin. Lyrics to some of the songs focus on the band members' younger years, like "Out ta Get Me", which focuses on lead singer Axl Rose's constant trouble with the law as a youth in Indiana.<br>
<br>
<i>Appetite for Destruction: Locked N' Loaded</i> edition was released on June 29, 2018. The box set includes 73 songs (49 of which were previously unreleased) on four compact discs and seven 12-inch 180-gram LPs. It features remastered versions of <i>Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide</i>, an EP of b-sides, 25 recordings from the group's 1986 Sound City Studios sessions with producer Manny Charlton, and two previously unreleased tracks from the group's sessions with Mike Clink. Three of the four songs from the <i>G N' R Lies</i> EP are included, with the exception of the controversial "One in a Million".<br>
In addition to the music, this release included a 96-page book with unreleased photos from Rose's personal archive, 12 lithographs visualizing each song on the album, and assorted replica memorabilia. "Shadow of Your Love" was released as a single on May 4, 2018, making it the band's first single in almost a decade. The full Locked N' Loaded edition initially retailed for $999, but an edition that included the five discs and extras and standard editions with just the remastered album and bonus tracks were also made available. The Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions were also made available for streaming and paid download. The remastered release resulted in <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> re-entering the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for the first time in 29 years.<br>
The Super Deluxe edition includes a Blu-ray disc with 96 kHz 24-bit 5.1 surround sound and stereo mixes (mixed by Elliot Scheiner and Frank Filipetti) of all of <i>Appetite for Destruction</i>, alongside bonus tracks "Shadow of Your Love", "Patience", "Used to Love Her", "You're Crazy", and "Move to the City" (1988 Acoustic version). In addition, this disc includes the music videos for "Welcome to the Jungle", "Sweet Child O' Mine", "Paradise City", and "Patience", and a previously-unreleased video for "It's So Easy".<br>

<br>
<i><b>A Head Full of Dreams</b></i> is the seventh studio album by British rock band Coldplay, released on 4 December 2015, by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and by Atlantic Records in the United States. Coldplay recorded the album from early to mid 2015, right after the completion of their previous album <i>Ghost Stories</i>, with a markedly different style and sound from its predecessors. For various songs, Coldplay collaborated with Beyoncé, Noel Gallagher, Tove Lo, Khatia Buniatishvili and Merry Clayton. The album was produced by Rik Simpson and Stargate. The album also features a sample of President Barack Obama singing "Amazing Grace" at Clementa C. Pinckney's funeral on the song "Kaleidoscope".<br>
<br>
The album received mixed reviews from critics. Commercially, it topped the UK Albums Chart, and peaked at number two in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Italy where it was held off the top spot by Adele's 25. At the 2016 Brit Awards the album was nominated for British Album of the Year. It was the eighth-best-selling album of 2015 with 1.9 million copies sold worldwide, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. It was the ninth-best-selling album of 2016, with 1.4 million copies sold worldwide. As of November 2017, the album has sold over six million copies. It was supported by five singles: "Adventure of a Lifetime", "Hymn for the Weekend", "Up &amp; Up", the title track, and "Everglow". The album was promoted by the successful A Head Full of Dreams Tour, that lasted two years.<br>
<br>
A Limited Edition Blu-ray with 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio was released via the band's website on 23 September 2016.<br>
