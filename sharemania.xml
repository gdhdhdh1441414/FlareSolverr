"Older" is the third studio album by English singer-songwriter George Michael, released on 13 May 1996 in Europe by Virgin Records and Aegean Records. The American release, which occurred one day later, was the first album released by DreamWorks Records. It was Michael's first studio album since 1990's <i>Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1</i> – the five-and-a-half-year gap was due to the legal battle that Michael experienced with his former record company Sony Music. Michael dedicated two years to the recording of <i>Older</i>, and the album found him exploring new musical territories in a more serious fashion compared to his previous work.<br>
<br>
At the time of release, the album was a huge commercial hit, particularly in Europe. In the UK, the album was particularly notable for producing a record six top three hit singles in a two-year span. The high sales of the album prompted a re-issue of the album, titled "<b>Older &amp; Upper</b>", eighteen months after the original release. The CD box set of "Older &amp; Upper" includes two discs, both in gold (instead of the original black from <i>Older</i>):<br>

<li>the original album;</li>
<li>an extra disc, titled <i>Upper</i>, packaged in a cardboard sleeve with the same cover as the box (which was a close-up of Michael's green eye from the original <i>Older</i> album).</li>
</ol>Alongside interactive elements, the <i>Upper</i> compact disc includes six tracks previously released on the singles from the album, notably featuring a version of "Fastlove (Part II)", only found on the second "Fastlove" promo single as "Fully Extended Mix – edit", differing both from the one included on the "Fastlove" single (running at 9:27) and from the edited version (4:39) included on the first "Fastlove" promo.<br>
