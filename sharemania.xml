"<b>Beat It</b>" is a song by American singer Michael Jackson from his sixth studio album, <i>Thriller</i> (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by Quincy Jones and co-produced by Jackson. Jones encouraged Jackson to include a rock song on the album. Jackson later said: "I wanted to write a song, the type of song that I would buy if I were to buy a rock song... and I wanted the children to really enjoy it—the school children as well as the college students." It includes a guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen.<br>
<br>
Following the successful <i>Thriller</i> singles "The Girl Is Mine" and "Billie Jean", "Beat It" was released on February 14, 1983, as the album's third single. It peaked at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, staying there for three weeks. It also charted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Black Singles chart. <i>Billboard</i> ranked the song No. 5 for 1983. It is certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With over 11 million copies sold worldwide, it is one of the best-selling singles of all time. "Beat It" was a number one hit in Europe, reaching number one in Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.<br>
<br>
The "Beat It" music video, which features Jackson bringing two gangs together through the power of music and dance, helped establish Jackson as an international pop icon. The single, along with its music video, helped make <i>Thriller</i> the best-selling album of all time. "Beat It" has been cited as one of the most successful, recognized, awarded and celebrated songs in the history of popular music; both the song and video had a large impact on pop culture.<br>
On November 11, 2022, Apple Music and Tidal have mistakenly updated two digitally restored 4K remasters (Thriller and Beat It) a week early. They were supposed to launch on YouTube on November 18, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of Thriller with the release of “Thriller 40”.<br>
<br>
"Beat It" received the 1984 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, as well as two American Music Awards. It was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked "Beat It" number 337 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004, and at number 185 in its 2021 update of the list. The magazine also named it the 81st greatest guitar song of all time. It was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.<br>
