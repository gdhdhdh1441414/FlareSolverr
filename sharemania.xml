<br>
<i><b>Beyoncé</b></i> is the self-titled fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Beyoncé. It was released on December 13, 2013, through Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. Developed as a visual album, every song is accompanied by a non-linear short film that illustrates the musical concepts. Beyoncé's desire to assert her full artistic freedom served as inspiration for the album's dark, personal subject matter, which incorporated feminist themes of sex, monogamy, beauty standards and relationship problems.<br>
<br>
The album's initial recording began in New York City, where Beyoncé invited the "world's best" producers and songwriters to live with her in a mansion for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with electronic producer and rock musician Boots. Their collaboration led to more sonically experimental material, which combined contemporary R&amp;B with electronic and soul music. Throughout this period, the album's songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyoncé devised an unexpected release.<br>
<br>
<i>Beyoncé</i> was released digitally on the iTunes Store, early in the day and without prior announcement or promotion, and debuted at number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, earning Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album on the chart. The album sold over 617,000 copies in the United States and 828,773 copies worldwide in its first three days of sales, becoming the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store up to that point. In the 19 days between the album's release and the end of 2013, <i>Beyoncé</i> sold 2.3 million copies worldwide, finishing the year as the tenth-best-selling album globally, according to the IFPI. The album has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.<br>
<br>
<i>Beyoncé</i> received widespread acclaim from critics upon release who praised its production, exploration of sexuality, vocal performance, as well as the album's surprise release strategy which was subsequently replicated by many artists. In 2020, <i>Beyoncé</i> was ranked 81st in <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.<br>
<br>
<i>Beyoncé</i> and its release is frequently credited with inventing the modern definition of the visual album, popularizing the surprise album release strategy, and provoking the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) to change the day of the week when music is released worldwide from Tuesday to Friday.<br>
