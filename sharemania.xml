<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Info zu <i>Nu King</i></b></span><br>
Forward-thinking, genre-defying, and massively creative, Derulo has staked his claim as one of the most dynamic forces on the global pop landscape. Since breaking through with his 5x RIAA platinum-certified single, “Whatcha Say,” the award-winning singer-songwriter who has a net worth in excess of $100 million, has sold more than 250 million singles worldwide and achieved15 platinum singles including "Wiggle", "Talk Dirty", "Want to Want Me," "Trumpets," "It Girl", "In My Head," “Ridin' Solo,” “Don’t Wanna Go Home,” “Marry Me,” “ The Other Side,” “Get Ugly,” “Swalla,” “Savage Love” and “Take You Dancing.” Since the start of his solo recording career in 2009, he has earned over 18.2B worldwide streams, and built an unstoppable social media following of over 117M followers across all platforms. Now at work on his highly anticipated fifth album – and full-length debut for Atlantic Records – Derulo has delivered an ongoing series of smash singles that have drawn a stunning 500M+ views, including the irresistibly buoyant “Acapulco,” the RIAA platinum-certified “Take You Dancing,” and Jawsh 685 x Jason Derulo’s 3x platinum-certified chart-topper, “Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat).”<br>
<br>
The latter track – and its official BTS remix – proved an unstoppable international sensation upon its 2020 arrival, peaking at #1 on Billboard’s “Hot 100” as well as atop charts in 16 additional countries around the world. A truly multi-dimensional creator, Derulo has also established himself as an actor and businessman, investing in enterprises like Catch L.A. and Rumble Boxing, becoming part-owner of Bedlam Vodka, launching an innovation-minded podcast, and developing a line of supplements and fitness products with the Najafi Group and BodyBuilding.com.<br>
<br>
What’s more, Derulo unveiled Jason Derulo’s UZO, an immersive new graphic novel from Z2 Comics based on a TikTok character created by the artist himself. With his TikTok regularly amassing over 10M views per post, Derulo notes that the platform has drastically reshaped his relationship with his fans. Derulo is now amongst TikTok’s biggest superstars, currently the 4th most followed male on the video-sharing platform with the 11th biggest account overall. He continues to see his already astronomical TikTok presence growing daily, now boasting more than 56.9M followers worldwide and over 1.2B likes. Reclaiming his title as the TikTok king, last year he released summer smash single “Slidin’” with a fan-challenged TikTok video to his own rendition of the electric slide.<br>
