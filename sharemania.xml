<b>G.O.A.T.</b> is an instrumental track by American progressive rock band Polyphia, released in 2018.. It's the last track on their third studio album <i>New Levels New Devils. </i><br>
Polyphia is a primarily instrumental progressive rock band formed in 2010 and based in Plano, Texas. It comprises of Tim Henson (Lead Guitar), Scott LePage (Rhythm Guitar), Clay Gober (Bass), and Clay Aeschliman (Drums). Initially going for a metal-inspired sound, they have since incorporated other musical styles, from electronic to hip-hop. <i>‘G.O.A.T’ </i>was following their 2017 EP <i>‘The Most Hated’, </i>where they made the controversial move to infuse a trap-based sound in to their music in an attempt to appeal to a more mainstream audience. G.O.A.T. is arguably a more refined version of this concept, where many claim the balance has been struck perfectly.<br>
<br>
Polyphia was originally known for classical guitar covers on YouTube. They achieved mainstream success after the guitar play-through of "Impassion", from their EP <i>Inspire</i>, went viral on YouTube. Their first EP, <i>Inspire</i>, and first LP, <i>Muse</i> employ more progressive metal influences than their later releases. This associated them with the djent movement, although they were characteristically less heavy and more melody-based than their peers. Their second studio album, <i>Renaissance</i>, saw the band diverge further away from metal, into a more progressive rock and math rock-influenced sound. They also began to mix elements of EDM, funk, and hip hop, with the single "LIT", a remix of the song "Light", the second track on <i>Renaissance</i>. This sound was further developed with the release of their second EP, <i>The Most Hated</i>, and third LP, <i>New Levels New Devils</i>, which featured production from hip hop and EDM producers Judge and Y2K. The band's fourth studio album, <i>Remember That You Will Die</i>, has continued in this vein, further exploring "trap percussion and hip hop stylings", as well as incorporating a variety of genres, such as bubblegum pop and bossa nova.<br>
