<br>
"<b>I/O</b>" (stylised as <b>i/o</b>) is the tenth studio album by English singer-songwriter and musician Peter Gabriel, released on 1 December 2023 through Real World Records. It is Gabriel's first album of new original material in over 21 years since Up (2002), marking the longest gap between two studio albums in his solo career. <br>
<br>
I/O had been in the works for nearly three decades (27 years and eight months), with its initial production dating back to April 1995, at around the same time Gabriel began recording Up. He began planning the follow-up to Up as early as 2000 and had originally intended to release it in 2004, but the album was repeatedly delayed, reworked and re-recorded at seven recording studios (and one arena during soundchecks while on tour with Sting in 2016) before its completion in December 2022. This was due to Gabriel focusing on other projects such as his two orchestral albums Scratch My Back (2010) and New Blood (2011), which contained covers of songs by other artists and rearrangements of his older material, respectively.<br>
<br>
Beginning in January 2023, Gabriel released a new single every full moon, with its alternative mix released on the following new moon, eventually culminating in the album's release at the end of the year; this replicates the 2010 double-sided single releases in promotion of And I'll Scratch Yours (2013). He has stated that he will release more songs in this format following the album's release. I/O received positive reviews from music critics, with praise being particularly directed towards Gabriel's vocals and songwriting. The album was also Gabriel's first to top the UK Albums Chart since So in 1986.<br>
<br>
From September to October 2021, Gabriel recorded the first band material for I/O in Real World Studios, alongside drummer Manu Katché, bassist Tony Levin and guitarist David Rhodes. They reportedly recorded 23 songs. Throughout the following year, Gabriel posted to social media a series of photos from these full band recording sessions, which were engineered by Oli Jacobs and Katie May. Brian Eno also played a large part, contributing production, synthesizers and rhythm programming, electronics and sound design throughout the album. Other notable musicians include Gabriel's daughter Melanie, who has contributed backing vocals since Up, Real World Studios' former head engineer, Oli Jacobs, and engineer Richard Chappell, who has worked at Real World since 1987. In June 2022, Katché said that the album was nearly complete. Gabriel has said that the album, "<i>to his ears,"</i> sounds <i>"very different"</i> track by track.<br>
<br>
Both Mark 'Spike' Stent and Tchad Blake contributed a mix of each song from I/O. Gabriel said, <i>"Rather than choosing only one of their mixes to release, I have decided that people should be able to hear all the great work that they are both doing." Stent's mixes are released as the 'Bright-Side Mix', while Blake's mixes are the 'Dark-Side Mix'. All the songs have each also received a third alternative mix in Dolby Atmos, called an 'In-Side Mix', by Hans-Martin Buff. The Atmos mix is <i>available on versions which include the Blu-ray audio disc.</i></i><br>
