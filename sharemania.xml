<b>Plot:</b> At the age of 9, Abraham Lincoln witnesses his mother being killed by a vampire, Jack Barts. Some 10 years later, he unsuccessfully tries to eliminate Barts but in the process makes the acquaintance of Henry Sturgess who teaches him how to fight and what is required to kill a vampire. The quid pro quo is that Abe will kill only those vampires that Henry directs him to. Abe relocates to Springfield where he gets a job as a store clerk while he studies the law and kills vampires by night. He also meets and eventually marries the pretty Mary Todd. Many years later as President of the United States, he comes to realize that vampires are fighting with the Confederate forces. As a result he mounts his own campaign to defeat them.<br>

<br>
"<b>Style</b>" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and the third single from her fifth studio album, <i>1989</i>, released in 2014. Swift wrote the song with producers Max Martin, Shellback, and Ali Payami. "Style" was released to radio on February 9, 2015, by Big Machine in partnership with Republic Records. An incorporation of pop, funk, disco, and electronic styles, "Style" is built on an electric guitar riff, pulsing synthesizers, and dense vocal reverb. The lyrics are about an on-and-off couple stuck in an unhealthy relationship because they are never "out of style".<br>
<br>
When "Style" was first released, critics generally praised the production and deemed it a highlight of <i>1989</i>, but a few considered the lyrics unsophisticated. In retrospect, critics have regarded it as one of Swift's best songs. "Style" was ranked in year-end best-of lists by <i>Pitchfork</i> (2014) and Pazz &amp; Jop (2015). In the US, the single peaked at number six and was <i>1989</i>'s third consecutive top-ten single on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and it was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). "Style" also reached the top ten and received multi-platinum certifications in Australia and Canada.<br>
<br>
American filmmaker Kyle Newman directed the music video for "Style", which was shot in Los Angeles and completed within four days in summer 2014. In the video, English actor Dominic Sherwood plays Swift's love interest. Swift contacted him by text message roughly a month before the shooting; the two had known of each other through mutual friends. By the time they worked on the video, Sherwood had finished the film <i>Take Down</i>, which was later renamed <i>Billionaire Ransom</i> (released in 2016).<br>
The video does not have a clear narrative but features disparate flashbacks of Swift and her love interest by the seashore, in the woods, and on car rides. At some points, the broken mirror pieces, through which Swift and her lover see each other, symbolize memories of a past relationship that linger on.<br>
