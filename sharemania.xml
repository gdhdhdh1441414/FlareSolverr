<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Info for <i>Acid Queen (Remastered)</i></b></span><br>
<br>
<br>
Acid Queen is Tina Turner's second solo album, released in 1975 on the EMI label in the UK, and on United Artists in the US. Although it is a Tina Turner solo album, the very first single, "Baby Get It On", was a duet with Ike Turner, Tina Turner's musical partner and husband at the time. As it turned out, it was her last solo album to be released before she left Ike Turner and the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue.<br>
<br>
Acid Queen takes its title from Tina Turner's role in Ken Russell's film version of The Who's classic rock opera Tommy, which had also featured Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jack Nicholson, Ann-Margret, and starred Roger Daltrey.<br>
<br>
Side A of the original vinyl album consists of rock covers. Besides a re-recorded version of the title track, it also contained the Rolling Stones' "Under My Thumb" and "Let's Spend the Night Together", The Who's "I Can See For Miles" and Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love". Side B was written and produced mainly by Ike and Tina Turner and includes what was to be the last moderately successful R&amp;B single for Ike &amp; Tina Turner, the disco-influenced "Baby Get It On" (US #88, R&amp;B #31). Other single releases include "Whole Lotta Love" (#61 R&amp;B) and "Acid Queen", released in early 1976.<br>

Stranger to Stranger, Paul Simon’s universally acclaimed new album entered the Billboard 200 chart at #3 with 68,000 equivalent album units (traditional album sales + track equivalent albums + streaming equivalent albums) earned in the week ending June 9th. The #3 bow marks the highest debut of Simon’s illustrious career and his highest-ranking record since Graceland peaked at #3 in 1987. Further, Stranger to Stranger debuted this week at #1 on Billboard’s Album Sales chart, which tracks traditional album sales only (no streaming). The record also debuted at #1 on both Billboard’s Rock and Americana chart.<br>
<br>
The album had a very strong showing internationally as well, including a #1 entry on the UK Album chart, his first studio album to reach #1 in the UK since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990.<br>
<br>
Stranger to Stranger, Simon’s first new album in five years has been met with resounding accolades both here and around the world. Huffington Post called the album “Paul Simon’s new future classic,” with the Daily Telegraph proclaiming, "Stranger to Stranger is another master class in the potential potency of words, melody, production and performance from an enduring songwriting genius."<br>
<br>
Classic Rock Magazine’s review declared: “Wearing its experimentalism lightly, Stranger to Stranger finds Simon boldly planting his flag in the avant-rock sound world of Radiohead or Four Tet, a master craftsman who knows the rules so well that he can now effortlessly break them in playful and surprising ways.”<br>
<br>
The Los Angeles Times called the album “exquisite” adding, “This is pop music at its most artful and relevant.” The UK’s Mail on Sunday 5-star review offered, “'A landmark...from a man who has made so many great albums, here is one more.”<br>
<br>
“Simon, through some miracle of intelligence, diligence, cosmopolitan interests, good taste, and good humor, bursts with sound and joy every time out,” exclaimed the blog Pretty Much Amazing.<br>
<br>
Produced by Simon and longtime musical partner Roy Halee, Stranger to Stranger is full of thrilling, inventive textures that provide a vivid and vital new context for Simon’s well-established virtuosity as a singer and songwriter. The project has been profiled in numerous media outlets including The New Yorker, The New York Times, Vox, VICE, Time Magazine, Huffington Post, Sodajerker, The Guardian, USA Today, Rolling Stone and the Associated Press, to name a few. The album has also received substantial coverage via NPR including NPR Music’s First Listen, All Songs Considered, Morning Edition, Fresh Air and World Café. In addition, Simon recently sat down for an interview with noted music journalist David Fricke for a special episode of SiriusXM’s program, The Writer’s Block.<br>
<br>
During his distinguished career Paul Simon has been the recipient of many honors and awards including 12 Grammy Awards, three of which (“Bridge Over Troubled Water”, “Still Crazy After All These Years” and “Graceland”) were albums of the year. In 2003 he was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for his work as half of the duo Simon and Garfunkel.<br>
