<br>
"<b>Run</b>" is a song by Scottish-Northern Irish alternative rock band Snow Patrol from their third studio album, <i>Final Straw</i> (2003). It was released in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2004 as the second single from the album. "Run" is described as a Britpop power ballad and was received with positive reviews by music critics, who compared it with Coldplay's "Yellow".<br>
<br>
Snow Patrol's frontman, Gary Lightbody, conceived the idea of writing "Run" in 2000. In an interview with Michael Odell, from <i>Q</i> magazine, Lightbody explained the song was not written about "being a child", as he tended to say. He described: "I was on a massive bender (binge drinking) and one night I was drinking in the bar of the Glasgow School of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn found me in the stairwell with blood coming out of my head ... I split my head open and my eye was closed and I lost a few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon." Besides Lightbody, it was written by Quinn, Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Iain Archer.<br>
<br>
The music video, directed by Paul Gorewas, was released to promote the song. It was filmed in September 2003, in a remote area of the county of Kent. It premiered in October 2003. During filming, people from the area called the police, because they noticed several red distress flares were used at night, which were those Snow Patrol members used. The single reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart in 2004, and since it has appeared multiple times in the chart. Additionally, "Run" reached the Top 40 of Ireland, the Netherlands and the American Modern Rock Tracks.<br>
<br>
"Run" appeared in various television programs and films including <i>One Tree Hill</i>, <i>Life as We Know It</i>, <i>Cold Case</i>, <i>Rescue Me</i>, <i>Doctor Who Confidential</i>, <i>Jericho</i>, <i>Mad Dogs, <i>The Chumscrubber </i></i>and <i>Bates Motel</i>. The song was also used in a trailer for the 2006 action-adventure drama film <i>The Guardian</i>.<br>
<br>
"Run" has been covered by multiple artists, including Leona Lewis, who released it as a single in November 2008. Her performance received positive reviews and commercial success, topping the charts of Austria, Ireland, Portugal and the United Kingdom, where it became the fastest-selling download ever after it sold 69,244 copies in just two days.

<b>Release Info</b><br>
The video track is ripped from Apple Music by SonMaxime (2160p HEVC 10-bit), left as is.<br>

<br>
This is one of my favorite songs. The editing took much time because I had to seamlessly cut 5 sections. In the album version the guitar sectioins repeat every time and the last chorus is longer.<br>
