"<b>Someone You Loved</b>" is a song recorded by Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi. It was released on 8 November 2018 as a download through Vertigo Records, the third single from his second extended play, <i>Breach</i> (2018), and was later included on his debut album, <i>Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent</i> (2019). The song was written by Capaldi, Samuel Romans, and its producers Thomas Barnes, Peter Kelleher and Benjamin Kohn. It was serviced to radio stations on 16 April 2019 as the first US single.<br>
<br>
"Someone You Loved" was a commercial success, peaking at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. The song became Capaldi's first No. 1 single, spending seven consecutive weeks atop the chart and was the best selling single of 2019 in the UK. It also peaked at No. 1 on the Irish Singles Chart, the Canadian Hot 100, and the Recording Industry Association of Malaysia singles chart. In the United States, "Someone You Loved" was a sleeper hit, topping the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in its 24th week on the chart. The song is certified Diamond or higher in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Poland, and the United States. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 62nd Grammy Awards. It also received an award for Song of the Year at the 2020 Brit Awards. As of 2023, "Someone You Loved" is the 3rd most streamed song on Spotify, with over 3 billion streams on the platform.<br>
<br>
In an interview with the British website <i>NME</i>, Capaldi said that it took him six months to write the song. He said, "<i>A lot of people say that 'the best songs fall into your lap' and that they're the easiest ones to write and take the shortest amount of time: I wholeheartedly disagree with that. I think my best songs come from me sitting at a piano, bashing my head against a brick wall for hours and hours on end to get one good melody."</i><br>
<br>
The music video (this one), featuring the singer was released on 29 August 2019. Here, Capaldi wanders the streets, following his lost love as his friends and strangers try to stop him from chasing after her. His brother, Aidan, also made an appearance at the beginning of the video where he pulls Lewis from the bench. The director of the music video, Ozzie Pullin, said that "The first person Lewis encounters is his brother, who pulls him up from the bench. This was an almost perfect metaphor because family members are usually the first people to push you forward." Capaldi said: <i>"For me the video is about the people we surround ourselves with that have the strength when we don't and help us continue to make the right decisions in moments of fear or hardship. In the moment we often choose to ignore friends and family, thinking our judgement is better, but of course in hindsight when you're in that headspace it's almost impossible to make the right decisions."</i><br>
<br>
Another music video for the song was created in partnership with UK organ donation charity Live Life Give Life. It features Capaldi's distant relative, actor Peter Capaldi as a bereaved husband who finds some joy when he visits the family of the woman his wife donated her heart to, and is able to listen to her heartbeat one last time.<br>
