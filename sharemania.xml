"<b>Training Season</b>" is a song by English-Albanian singer Dua Lipa. It was released on 15 February 2024, as the second single from her upcoming third studio album, <i>Radical Optimism</i> (2024). Lipa premiered the song at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards before its release. "Training Season" peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and at number six on the <i>Billboard</i> Global 200. Elsewhere, the song reached the top ten in various countries, including Belgium, The Netherlands, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Ireland, Lebanon, Luxembourg, and New Zealand.<br>
<br>
Lipa wrote the song with songwriters Caroline Ailin and Tobias Jesso Jr., along with producers Danny L Harle and Kevin Parker. The same five also wrote the "Houdini" single. "Training Season" is an empowering anthem inspired by mediocre dates. Dua Lipa conveys a message to men that she will no longer tolerate subpar treatment. <i>"Training season's over. You're done teaching people how to do things right,"</i> said Lipa. <i>"That's the vibe."</i><br>
Lipa describes the song's inspiration as a culmination of frustrating dates, stating, <i>"The last one was the final straw."</i> The next morning, she arrived at the studio to Ailin and Tobias Jesso asking her how her date went. <i>"I immediately declared 'TRAINING SEASON IS OVER,' and like the best 'day after' debriefs with your mates, we had a lot of laughs and it all quickly came together from there".</i><br>
While the song addresses setting boundaries and demanding respectful treatment, it also delves deeper into Duo Lipa's personal journey. <i>"I have never felt more confident, clear, or empowered,"</i> she said. <i>"And while it may be that training season is never over for any of us, you start to see the beauty in finding that person to experience it with. You stop looking for the trainees and become more interested in having someone where you are and someone to grow with."</i><br>
<br>
Vincent Haycock directed the music video for "Training Season", which was released alongside the song. It opens with Lipa getting bombarded by a wave of desperate voicemails from exes, their apologies washing over her in a cacophony of regret.<br>
<br>
The music videos from the London Sessions are directed by Paul Dugdale.<br>
