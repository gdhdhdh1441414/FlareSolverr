"<b>Everything I Wanted</b>" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by American singer and songwriter Billie Eilish, and co-written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, who also produced it. Darkroom and Interscope Records released the track as a standalone single on November 13, 2019, and later added it to the reissue of Eilish's debut studio album <i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i> (2019) in December that year<i>.</i> It is a house and electronica-influenced pop and alternative pop track with minimal piano and downtempo bass guitar instrumentation.<br>
<br>
The song is inspired by a nightmare the singer had one night. In her dream, Eilish killed herself by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge only to witness her friends, work colleagues and fans ignore her demise. She woke up with the feeling that despite achieving "everything I wanted," some still see her as disposable. Eilish turned to Finneas for support; he comforted his little sister, saying she should "change the way that you see yourself" and "they don't deserve you."<br>
Billie Eilish wrote the woozy song with Finneas at their home studio in Highland Park, California, and on tour. Finneas also took care of the production and sang the backing vocals.<br>
<br>
"Everything I Wanted" received acclaim from critics, several of whom praised the music and lyrics. The song reached number eight on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, becoming Eilish's second top-ten hit in the United States. It debuted at number one in the record charts of several countries, including Ireland and Norway, and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. "Everything I Wanted" has received several certifications, including quadruple platinum in Canada. On November 24, 2020, the song received nominations for Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making it Eilish's second consecutive year for earning a nomination in such categories, with it winning Record of the Year.<br>
<br>
Eilish directed the song's accompanying music video, which was uploaded to her YouTube channel on January 23, 2020. The video depicts Eilish and Finneas holding hands while driving in a Dodge Challenger through a city and into the ocean; it received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised its visual theme and message.<br>
Eilish has performed "Everything I Wanted" live several times; it was included on the setlist of her When We All Fall Asleep Tour (2019) and Where Do We Go? World Tour (2020). Eilish and Finneas performed the track during a 50-minute livestream for Verizon Communications in April 2020, as well as at the 63rd Grammy Awards in March 2021.<br>
