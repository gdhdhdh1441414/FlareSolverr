Hello!<br>
<br>
Is anybody able to provide a video rip of the following programme airing on 25 June 2024? It would be very appreciated by me, and the Coldplay community as were hoping they will include rare footage of older Glastonbury sets that haven't received rebroadcasts. <br>
<br>

<br>
Thanks in advance.
