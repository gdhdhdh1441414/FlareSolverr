"<b>Extreme Ways</b>" is a song by American electronica musician Moby. It was released as the second single from his sixth studio album <i>18</i> on June 24, 2002. The song features Moby's own vocals but samples the strings from Hugo Winterhalter's 1971 cover of Nilsson's "Everybody's Talkin'," and the funky drum beats from Melvin Bliss' "Synthetic Substitution" (1973) and Coke Escovedo's "I Wouldn't Change A Thing" (1976).<br>
The single peaked at #39 in the UK. In 2007 it re-entered the UK Top 50 after its use in <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i> movie.<br>
<br>
The track is notably used at the conclusion of all five of the <i>Bourne</i> films. For the first two Bourne films in the series, <i>The Bourne Identity</i> and <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>, the original version of the song was used during the closing credits.<br>
For the third film in the series, <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i>, a new version, "Extreme Ways (Bourne's Ultimatum)", was recorded and released both on that film's soundtrack on July 31, 2007, and as a one-track CD single on September 17, 2007.<br>
For the fourth film in the series, <i>The Bourne Legacy</i>, another version, "Extreme Ways (Bourne's Legacy)", was recorded and released on that film's soundtrack on August 7, 2012. This version was recorded partly at Moby's home studio in Los Angeles and partly at Sony Pictures Studios. At Sony, Moby worked with a 110 piece orchestra with the help of composer James Newton Howard, who scored the film, and composer Joseph Trapanese. In addition to the lyrical track, the group also recorded a purely orchestral version of the song.<br>
For the fifth film in the series, <i>Jason Bourne</i>, Moby recorded another version, "Extreme Ways (Jason Bourne)", that was released on that film's soundtrack on July 29, 2016.<br>
<br>
The song was also significantly featured in multiple seasons of the Korean game show, <i>The Genius</i> and it plays at the end of <i>The Simpsons</i> episode "Bart Vs. Itchy &amp; Scratchy" (2019).<br>
<br>
In 2021 a new version of the song was recorded for the album "Reprise" and released under the title "Extreme Ways (Reprise Version)" with remixes by Felsmann + Tiley and Peter Gregson. These remixes were also included in the 2022 album "Reprise Remixes".<br>
<br>
In the music video, directed by Wayne Isham, Moby is backed by a band of look-alikes as he performs the tune. Isham, who helmed clips for the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Britney Spears, came up with the concept to emphasize that Moby is a one-man band.<br>
