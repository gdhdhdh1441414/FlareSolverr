Lainey Wilson had just won 2 CMA awards 3 weeks before and seems to be exploding in popularity. None of which I knew. So I had a hard time getting a good position, thankfully I was able to get behind a group who didn't mind shoving their way thru the crowd. <br>
<br>
Meant to stick it out for Scotty McCreery and one other act but it's massively crowded, my back is hurting and I already smoked so much weed I am about to fall over. I thought she was great but as soon she starts the terrible 4NonBlonde's song I am on my phone looking at Miranda Lambert ticket prices on Tickpick. See one for $20. Text my friend and he says he is ready to split too so we head out. It's about 8 and she usually goes on at 8:30. <br>
<br>
My friend is a safe, sober and cautious driver. In this case he was a little too cautious, slowing and stopping for yellow lights and not speeding around the cars in front of him. End up walking thru the door at 8:35 for a set that probably started closer to 8:20. Oh well, win some, lose some. <br>
<br>
I am the master at hitting multiple events in a night often via public transportation or even on foot but in this case it didn't quite work out. But even seeing Miranda do Bluebird by itself is worth $20. <br>

Just Like Heaven<br>
<br>
raw wavs <br>
<br>
my chances of finding a ride to Pappy &amp; Harriet's was next to nil as were CSS chances of ever touring the US again so even though there was just a handful of bands I even liked or was familiar with, I decided to suck it up and go to Just Like Heaven, setting a strict $40 budget and finding ticket in the parking lot at that price immediately upon arriving. After Tegan And Sara toured Canada last month playing one of my all time favorite albums by anybody, If It Was You, this set had a whopping 1 song. Phantogram was pretty good. The rest I pretty much suffered thru as the other stage was covered by another taper so I decided to do my due diligence and get what I can. Whatever happens with that is up to him but here is the complete Orion stage, untracked. At least I caught a good spot leaning against a barricade and security was handing out water. I may have tracked versions eventually but I never wanted to hear most of this a first time.<br>
<br>
Do whatever you want with this, feel free to track out and share wherever you want.<br>
