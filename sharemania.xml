Anyone got a quality version of this?<br>
<br>
There are some uploads on YouTube, however obviously those are quite compressed.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the Bizarrap show that took place at the Palermo Racecourse, which was broadcasted by DirecTV GO. As a fervent admirer of Bizarrap's work and a keen follower of live musical performances, I was intrigued by this particular event given its unique venue and the artist's renowned reputation for delivering electrifying shows.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I was unable to watch the live broadcast and have since been eagerly seeking ways to view the recording. Therefore, I am reaching out to request any information regarding the availability of video content from the Bizarrap show at the Palermo Racecourse. <br>
<br>
I appreciate yours time and consideration in addressing my request. I look forward to any information you can provide that will assist me in accessing this remarkable performance.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much.
