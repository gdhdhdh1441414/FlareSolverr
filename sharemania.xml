"<b>Illusion</b>" is a song by English-Albanian singer Dua Lipa. Lipa announced the release of "Illusion" as a single on 4 April 2024, via her social media accounts, along with its cover artwork and a 30-second snippet of the song. It was released through Warner Records on 11 April 2024, as the third single from her third studio album, <i>Radical Optimism</i> (2024). She wrote the song along with London-based Caroline Ailin, Canadian songwriter Tobias Jesso Jr., British producer Danny L Harle and Australian musician Kevin Parker (of Tame Impala). The same five also penned her "Houdini" and "Training Season" singles. "Illusion" topped the US Dance/Electronic Songs chart and reached the top ten in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>
Dua Lipa flips the script in "Illusion," a dance anthem where she sees through a deceiving lover's act. Piano chords and handclaps set the stage for Lipa's confession of past mistakes, but she's taking off the rose-colored glasses. Now she sees through the façade and laughs at this illusionist's attempt to manipulate her. Dua Lipa embraces the moment and dances on her own terms – a testament to her newfound self-awareness.<br>
<i>"It's about knowing what you're getting yourself into, but staying for the hell of it,"</i> said Lipa. <i>"The joke's on them, it's the fun of playing someone at their own game because ultimately you won't fall for an illusion."</i><br>
<br>
Lipa pinpoints "Illusion" as a pivotal moment in the recording process for Radical Optimism. It was the spark that ignited the creative fire, providing the foundation for the rest of the album.<br>
<i>"Of course, it's a pop record. I'm a pop artist, that's what I do,"</i> Dua said, <i>"But I think overall, the different sounds that are being used, the different breaks in the music, the use of musical samples, whether that's with Kevin's voice or with the different instruments that we used... it was me going completely out of what I knew and exploring something different."</i><br>
