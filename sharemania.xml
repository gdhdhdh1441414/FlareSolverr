"<b>Now and Then</b>" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 2 November 2023. Dubbed "the last Beatles song", it appeared on a double A-side single, paired with a new stereo remix of the band's first single, "Love Me Do" (1962), with the two serving as "bookends" to the band's history. It topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria, and reached the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. It is the only Beatles UK number one single not attributed to the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership.<br>
<br>
Originally recorded as a demo by John Lennon in 1977. The cassette tape was given to Paul McCartney by Lennon's widow Yoko Ono. During the sessions for the Anthology CD box sets in 1994, McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison worked on the tape with producer Jeff Lynne, but quickly abandoned the song due to the inferior sound quality of the recording and Harrison, reportedly, disliking the song. They did, however, finish two other Lennon demos, Free As A Bird and Real Love, which were released as singles.<br>
<br>
McCartney and Starr went back to work on the song in the early half of 2023, after film director Peter Jackson was able to isolate Lennon's vocals from the demo tape using AI technology. The restoration was followed by an addition of a string section written by Martin, McCartney, and Ben Foster, recorded at Capitol Studios. The piece was given the decoy name of "Give &amp; Take" to avoid leaks from the musicians and recorded during late April 2022. Finally, McCartney and Martin added portions of original vocal recordings of "Here, There and Everywhere", "Eleanor Rigby", and "Because" into the new song, following the methods used for the 2006 remix album <i>Love</i>. Ben Lindbergh of <i>The Ringer</i> contrasted the original recording to the released version: "McCartney collaborates with his former muse not just by building on Lennon's work, but by undoing it. The Beatles release is almost a minute shorter than the Lennon demo, largely because the latter includes two pre-chorus bridges that the former removes (aside from a subtle, hard-to-hear allusion in McCartney's piano chords during the new solo)". The finished track was produced by McCartney and Martin, while Lynne was credited for "additional production", and mixed by Spike Stent. Meanwhile, the stereo and Dolby Atmos mixes, alongside the vinyl mastering, were completed at Abbey Road Studios.<br>
<br>
The music video for "Now and Then" directed by Peter Jackson was released on 3 November 2023. It features never-before-seen footage of the Beatles, including snippets provided by Pete Best, scenes filmed during the 1995 recording sessions for <i>Anthology</i>, unseen home movie footage of Harrison, as well as new footage of McCartney and Starr performing. Additionally, visual effects produced by Wētā FX were added.<br>
