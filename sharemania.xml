Hi.<br>
For some time now I have been looking for the discography (albums and singles) of these two bands.<br>
From The Walkmen I was able to get only one album: A Hundred Miles Off. I also got a torrent that apparently has all their discography including rare tracks, but after trying many times, I can't download anything.<br>
From Stellastarr* I have not been able to get absolutely nothing.<br>
I would be very grateful if anyone has any CD rips of either band. It doesn't matter if they have the artwork or not.
