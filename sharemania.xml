"<b>Houdini</b>" is a song by English-Albanian singer Dua Lipa. It was released on 9 November 2023 through Warner Records, as the lead single from Lipa's upcoming third studio album, <i>Radical Optimism</i> (2024). Houdini was produced by Danny L Harle and Kevin Parker. Lipa co-wrote the song with Harle, Parker, Caroline Ailin and Tobias Jesso Jr.<br>
<br>
"Houdini" was met with generally positive reviews by music critics, who praised the sonic evolution from her previous album <i>Future Nostalgia</i> (2020). Commercially, the single peaked at number one in several countries including Belgium, Bulgaria, and Greece. It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and the top 10 in various countries, including Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and France. In the United States, the song peaked at number 11 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and topped the Dance/Electronic Songs chart for thirteen weeks. "Houdini" also peaked at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> Global 200.<br>
<br>
Harry Houdini (1874-1926) was a Hungarian-American magician and stunt performer. He wowed crowds by wriggling out of chains and straitjackets, even pulling off daring underwater escapes against the clock.<br>
Taking a page from Houdini's playbook, Dua Lipa likens her knack for slipping out of relationships to his masterful escapes. With a sassy challenge, she confronts her beau, demanding to know if he's got what it takes to keep her around. Dua Lipa warns him that if he doesn't measure up, she'll vanish faster than Houdini himself.<br>
Lipa said the song is about <i>"the most light and freeing parts of my singledom."</i> She added it is <i>"very tongue in cheek, exploring the idea of whether someone is really worth my while or if I'll ghost them in the end."<br>
</i><br>
"Houdini" is the first song Dua Lipa's wrote about the exhilaration of singlehood. Amid the flirtatious lyrics, the song exudes the empowerment that has consistently defined her musical ethos.<br>
<i>"The lyrics are a bit cheeky, but there is a real underlying message of understanding yourself deeply and having no guilt about knowing your self-worth," </i>she told Apple Music.<i> "Sometimes you just have to pull a Houdini and leave a situation that's no longer serving you."</i><br>
<br>
Dua Lipa released a live recording of the song titled <i>London Sessions</i> (this release) for digital download and streaming on 12 January 2024. A music video of the live performance was released on YouTube the same day.<br>

Hey, on YT there is a channel called "AjaxStriker", with good mixes and so on, but all links seem dead and he hasn't posted for 4 years and youtube compression sucks, so does anybody by chance have his mixes? Thanks in advance.
