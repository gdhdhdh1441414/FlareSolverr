I see a lot of albums in dolby/Atmos and 5.1 - 7.1 audio. Is there a way to enjoy these on our portable devices or are these rips mainly for professional home theater systems? <br>
<br>
I seen some headphones claiming they are dolby Atmos (like movies or gaming). I'm sure they would work well with music so as long as it's dolby 3D audio.<br>
<br>
Has anyone tried these headphones or is it best to just use a home theater system to enjoy these tidal dolby/Atmos music?<br>
<br>
Here is a link to some Atmos headphones:<br>

<br>
Do you think those are good? And does Atmos need a subscription or is it a free codec/decoder? Like VLC, foobar or media player?
